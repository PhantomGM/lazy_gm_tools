<p>This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can take a Magic action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bullseye Lantern (filled and lit)</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
