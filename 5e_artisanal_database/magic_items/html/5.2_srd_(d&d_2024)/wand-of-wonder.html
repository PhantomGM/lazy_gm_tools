<h1>Wand of Wonder</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wand</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.2 SRD (D&amp;D 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge while choosing a point within 120 feet of yourself. That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell's maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM determines randomly which among them are affected.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regaining Charges.</em></strong> The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.</p>
