<h1>Bag of Beans</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.2 SRD (D&amp;D 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.</p>
<p>If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.</p>
