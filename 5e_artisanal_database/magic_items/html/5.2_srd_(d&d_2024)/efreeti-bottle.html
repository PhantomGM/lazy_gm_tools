<p>When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an <strong>Efreeti</strong> appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
<p>The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1d10</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2–9</td>
<td>The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>The efreeti understands your languages and can cast <em>Wish</em> once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
</tr>
