<p><strong><em>Tree Form.</em></strong> You can take a Magic action to plant one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic that can be discerned with the <em>Detect Magic</em> spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to a staff.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regaining Charges.</em></strong> The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.2_srd_(d&d_2024)/staff-of-the-woodlands.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
