<h1>Sea Witch’s Amulet</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This locket was dredged from the remains of a long-dead sea monster. The amulet has 3 charges. While wearing this strange oyster-shaped pendant, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose one creature within 30 feet that is laughing, singing, or speaking. The target makes a DC 15 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  or you steal its voice. As long as you are wearing the amulet, you can speak with the target’s voice. For as long as you possess a target’s voice in the amulet, the target is unable to speak. </p>
<p>At the end of every 24 hours, the amulet expends 1 charge per voice stored inside of it. When the amulet has no charges to expend, the stolen voice is released and returns to the target. You can use a bonus action to release a voice stored in the amulet. When the amulet has no voices stored in it and is soaked in sea water for 24 hours, it regains 1 charge. </p>
<p>Destroying the amulet releases any stolen voices stored inside and creates a brief piercing shriek in a 100-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 10 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or be <em>stunned</em>  until the start of its next turn.</p>
