<h1>Ring of Spell Storing</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Ring</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This ring stores spells cast into it, and holds them for later use. While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored within it. The spell has the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack modifier, and spellcasting ability of the original caster. Once the spell is cast, it is no longer stored within the ring.</p>
<p>When found, the ring contains 1d6 – 1 levels of stored spells, as determined by the Narrator. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. To store a spell, a creature casts any spell of 1st- to 5th-level while touching the ring. The spell has no immediate effect. The level the spell is cast at determines how much space it uses. If the ring cannot store the spell, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.</p>
