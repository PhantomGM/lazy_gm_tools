<h1>Atlas to Libation</h1>

<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>

<p>This golden-brown parchment has an odd handle-like wooden stave and a seal marked with an ale tankard. As a bonus action, you can break the seal and unfurl the map. When you do so, the map fills in with accurate topography in a 1-mile radius around you. A miniature image of you appears at the map’s center along with a dotted line leading to an X that marks the nearest potable alcohol. The map immediately rolls back up if brought within 50 feet of alcohol or if no alcohol is within 1 mile when the seal is opened. </p>
<p>Once used in this way, the seal reforms and is usable again after 24 hours.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can form a cylinder with the map and grasp it by the handle as an action. If you do so, the map hardens into a tall wooden tankard and magically fills with high quality ale, then loses all magical properties and becomes a mundane object.</p>
