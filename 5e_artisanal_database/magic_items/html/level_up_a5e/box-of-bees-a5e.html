<h1>Box of Bees</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>

</ul>
<p>Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite painful—the <em>box of bees</em> is a particularly popular example and now sold by those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned, though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating inside.</p>
<p>When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack roll or ability check with <em>disadvantage</em> . </p>
<p>When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has <em>disadvantage</em>  on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round. </p>
<p>The box has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
