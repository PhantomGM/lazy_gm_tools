<h1>Wood Woad Amulet</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This wooden amulet painted with blue pigment is carved to resemble a humanoid figure armed with a club and shield. Its face is featureless apart from two empty eyes that glow with a faint yellow light. When you hold it to your ear, you hear faint whispers. Once a day as an action, you can hold the amulet to your ear and listen to its whispers to guide you. You gain an expertise die to one ability check made in the next minute. You may roll the expertise die before or after making the ability check, after which the effect ends. This ability recharges at dusk each day.</p>
<p>Additionally you may crush the amulet as a reaction, destroying it to free the spirit within and gain the ‘woad’s blessing’. You can expend the woad’s blessing to roll an additional d20 when you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and choose which of the d20s is used. You can roll the additional die after making the roll, but before the outcome is determined. Once you have used the woad’s blessing, the amulet’s magic dissipates.</p>
