<p>Precious beyond reckoning, this silver leaf has fallen from a Memory Tree and contains a psychic imprint of the living creature it was once connected to. It can only be attuned when pressed against the forehead and is often set into a woven headband. </p>
<p><strong>Legends and Lore</strong> Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Memory Leaf</em>, which fell from a Memory Tree in ages past. </p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> Sometimes those who wear the leaf sense those who have worn it before.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The leaf can grant knowledge about the ancient world.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact Properties</strong></p>
<p>The _Memory Leaf h_as one lesser artifact benefit. There is a 50% chance when you attune to the leaf that you discover a lesser artifact detriment. </p>
<p>In some cases the benefit and detriment are reflections of the former personality, and you may acquire those traits while attuned to it.</p>
<p><strong>Magic</strong></p>
<p>While this leaf is pressed against your forehead, you can cast <em>legend lore</em>  to ask the psychic imprint within the leaf one question about the ancient world. Once you have used this property 3 times, it cannot be used again until next dawn. </p>
