<h1>Staff of the Woodlands</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.</p>
<p>While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast pass without trace, or to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: <em>animal friendship</em>  (1 charge), <em>speak with animals</em>  (1 charge), __barkskin_  (2 charges), <em>locate animals or plants</em>  (2 charges), __speak with plants_  (3 charges), __awaken_ (5 charges), __wall of thorns_  (6 charges).</p>
<p><em><strong>Tree Form</strong>.</em> As an action you can plant the staff in the earth and expend 1 charge, transforming it into a full-grown tree. The tree is 60 feet tall, has a 5-foot-wide trunk, and its highest branches fill a 20-foot radius. The tree looks ordinary but radiates faint transmutation magic if inspected with __detect magic ._ By using an action to touch the tree and speak the staff’s command word, you can transform it back into a staff. Creatures in the tree fall when the staff reverts to its original form.</p>
<p>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties.</p>
