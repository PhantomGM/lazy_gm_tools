<h1>Draconic Diorama</h1>

<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>

<p>This Tiny diorama is contained within a cube-shaped box 5 inches on each side. The bottom is lead and the rest made of transparent crystal. Inside the box there are several trees made of paper and wire, a treasure chest made of clay, and a 1½-inch dragon skeleton. The skeleton stands in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move while being observed.</p>
<p>While you carry the diorama, you have <em>advantage</em>  on <em>saving throws</em>  against Frightful Presence.</p>
<p>A successful DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box. </p>
<p><strong>Curse.</strong> While carrying the cursed diorama you are compelled to amass more wealth. As long as you are compelled, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma <em>saving throw</em>  to willingly part with the diorama, even temporarily.</p>
