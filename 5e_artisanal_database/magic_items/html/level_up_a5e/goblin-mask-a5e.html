<p>Your vision shifts into a sickly yellow tint. Your muscles tense up and contract inside you, made twitchy as new sensory information floods your brain. You gain the following benefits and powers while wearing the <em>goblin mask</em>:</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkvision</em>.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goblin Tongue</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Goblin as a language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nimble Escape.</strong></em> This mask has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action during your turn. The mask regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at sunrise. If you expend the mask’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the mask shrivels away and is destroyed.</p>
