<h1>Blackbird Pie</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This item appears to be a freshly baked pie in a tin. When the crust is fully punctured the pie explodes as 24 magic blackbirds fly out and flit through the air in a 20-foot radius for 2d4 rounds, at which point the birds and the pie disappear. A creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 1 slashing damage on a failure. A creature damaged by the blackbirds has <em>disadvantage</em>  on ability checks and <em>attack rolls</em>  until the beginning of its next turn. The blackbirds are magical and cannot be interacted with like normal animals, and attacking them has no effect.</p>
