<h1>Mourning Medallion</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This medallion hangs from a very old rope made from the braided hair of those long past. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing it, before going <em>unconscious</em>  you can use your reaction to ask the medallion a single question which it answers with “yes,” “no,” or “unknown.” It answers truthfully, using the knowledge of all those who have died. Roll 1d20 after using this feature. On a result of 5 or less, the medallion becomes a mundane piece of mourning jewelry. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a <em>long rest</em> .</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can instead use your reaction to rip the medallion from its braid when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright. You drop to 1 hit point instead and the medallion becomes a mundane piece of mourning jewelry.</p>
