<h1>Grappling Gun</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This device resembles a crossbow with a grappling hook fixed onto a spear that emerges from the front of it. You can use an action to fire it at a perch within 120 feet—a crux of tree boughs, the corner of a building, the top of a street light, a cluster of rocks across a chasm—and make a ranged weapon attack roll against AC 13. On a successful hit the device’s grappling hook affixes itself to the perch and you can use a bonus action to retract the line, moving to a square adjacent to the grappling hook. When you are within 10 feet of the grappling hook you can use a reaction to return it to the <em>grappling gun</em>. </p>
<p>A <em>grappling gun</em> that has its line obstructed by another creature or broken (AC 20, 20 hit points) becomes inoperable until it is reloaded with an action. </p>
<p>In addition, you can fire the <em>grappling gun</em> as an attack against a creature (range 60/120 ft.), dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage. On a hit the creature makes a DC 10 Strength <em>saving throw</em>  or is knocked <em>prone</em> .</p>
