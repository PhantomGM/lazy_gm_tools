<h1>Talisman of Ultimate Evil</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Legendary</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This talisman’s blasphemous nature harms creatures that do not have the Evil trait, dealing 6d6 necrotic damage when touched (or 8d6 necrotic damage to a creature with the Good trait). A creature carrying or holding this item takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it does so. </p>
<p>A cleric or herald with the Evil trait can use this talisman as a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to <em>spell attack rolls</em>  while held or worn.</p>
<p>In addition, the talisman has 6 charges. While wielded or worn, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose a target within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the creature has the Good trait, it makes a DC 20 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em>  or is destroyed by a flaming pit that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no trace of it or the target remains. Once all charges are expended, the talisman melts into a puddle of ooze. </p>
