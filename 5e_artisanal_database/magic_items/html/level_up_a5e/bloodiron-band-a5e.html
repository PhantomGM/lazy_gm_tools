<h1>Bloodiron Band</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bloodiron Band gleams a metallic crimson and is set with dozens of spikes on the inside so that it pierces the skin as it closes on the forearm during attunement.</p>
<p>Wearing this band increases your Strength to 20. It has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Because of the horrific materials required in its construction, each band comes with a terrible cost. While attuned to the bloodiron band, your maximum hit points are reduced by a number equal to twice your level. Additionally, at the start of your turn, if another creature within 15 feet of you is <em>bloodied</em> , you must make a DC 15 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  (gaining <em>advantage</em>  if the creature is an ally). On a failure, you must attempt to move to a space within reach and take the attack action against that creature.</p>
