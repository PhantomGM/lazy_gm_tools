<h1>Folding Boat</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This dark wood box with nautical-themed carvings measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and always floats in water. Three command words control its functions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first command word turns the box into a 10-foot long boat that is 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep. It comes equipped with one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail, and can hold up to 4 Medium creatures comfortably.</li>
<li>The second command word causes the box to unfold into a 24-foot long ship that is 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep. This ship has a deck, rowing seats, 5 sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can hold 15 Medium creatures comfortably.</li>
<li>A third command word causes the folding boat to revert to its original shape, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain outside and any objects that can fit inside do.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.</p>
