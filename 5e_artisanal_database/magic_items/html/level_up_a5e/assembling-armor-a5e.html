<h1>Assembling Armor</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up A5E</li>
</ul>
<p>This thick leather belt pouch jingles softly as if filled with metal rings. This item has 6 charges and regains 1d4 each dawn.</p>
<p>You can use an action to speak one of three command words and expend 1 or more of the pouch’s charges, causing metal rings and plates to stream out of the pouch and assemble into a suit of armor on your body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leather brigandine (1 charge)</li>
<li>Half plate (2 charges)</li>
<li>Full plate (3 charges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to speak a fourth command word and expend 1 charge to summon a medium shield from the pouch.</p>
<p>If you are already wearing armor that provides equal or greater protection than the armor provided by the pouch, the charges are wasted and nothing happens. If you are wearing armor that provides less protection, the assembling armor reinforces the armor you are already wearing and you benefit from the same level of protection as if you activated the pouch while unarmored. The armor remains on your person for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to dismiss it, after which it disassembles and returns to the pouch. </p>
