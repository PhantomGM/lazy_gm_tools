<h1>Marvelous Clockwork Mallard</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This intricate clockwork recreation of a Tiny duck is fashioned of brass and tin. Its head is painted with green lacquer, the bill is plated in gold, and its eyes are small chips of black onyx. You can use an action to wind the mallard's key, and it springs to life, ready to follow your commands. While active, it has AC 13, 18 hit points, speed 25 ft., fly 40 ft., and swim 30 ft. If reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes nonfunctional and can't be activated again until 24 hours have passed, during which time it magically repairs itself. If damaged but not disabled, it regains any lost hit points at the next dawn. It has the following additional properties, and you choose which property to activate when you wind the mallard's key.</p>
