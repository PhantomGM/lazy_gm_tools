<p>Created from the treated body of a destroyed Apaxrusl (see Tome of Beasts 2), this leather armor constantly sheds fine sand. The faint echoes of damned souls also emanate from the armor. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, you can move through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone at your speed. While doing so, you don't disturb the material you move through. Because the souls that once infused the apaxrusl remain within the armor, you are susceptible to effects that sense, target, or harm fiends, such as a paladin's Divine Smite or a ranger's Primeval Awareness. This armor has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As a reaction, when you are hit by an attack, you can expend 1 charge and make the armor flow like sand. Roll a 1d12 and reduce the damage you take by the number rolled.</p>
