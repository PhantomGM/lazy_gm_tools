<p>This bronze bracer is crafted in the shape of a scorpion, its legs curled around your wrist, tail raised and ready to strike. While wearing this bracer, you are immune to the poisoned condition. The bracer has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. In addition, you can expend 2 charges as a bonus action to coat a weapon you touch with venom. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using the weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.</p>
