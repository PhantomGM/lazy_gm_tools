<p>Inspired by the searing breath weapon of a light drake (see Tome of Beasts 2), this whip seems to have filaments of light interwoven within its strands. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d4 radiant damage. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target is blinded until the end of its next turn. The whip has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn or when exposed to a daylight spell for 1 minute. While wielding the whip, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transform the whip into a searing beam of light. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and make one attack roll with this whip against that creature. If the attack hits, that creature and each creature in a line that is 5 feet wide between you and the target takes damage as if hit by this whip. All of this damage is radiant. If the target is undead, you have advantage on the attack roll.</p>
