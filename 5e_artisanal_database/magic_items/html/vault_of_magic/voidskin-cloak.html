<h1>Voidskin Cloak</h1>

<p>This pitch-black cloak absorbs light and whispers as it moves. It feels like thin leather with a knobby, scaly texture, though none of that detail is visible to the eye. While you wear this cloak, you have resistance to necrotic damage. While the hood is up, your face is pooled in shadow, and you can use a bonus action to fix your dark gaze upon a creature you can see within 60 feet. If the creature can see you, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it can't be affected by the cloak again for 24 hours. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.</p>
