<p>The abdomen of this beetleshaped brooch is decorated with the grim semblance of a human skull. If you hold it in your hand for 1 round, an Abyssal inscription appears on its surface, revealing its magical nature. While wearing this brooch, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
- The scarab has 9 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a conjuration spell or a harmful effect originating from a celestial creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into dust and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.</p>
