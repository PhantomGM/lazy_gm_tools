<h1>Ogre's Pot</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This cauldron boils anything placed inside it, whether venison or timber, to a vaguely edible paste. A spoonful of the paste provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. As a bonus action, you can speak the pot's command word and force it to roll directly to you at a speed of 40 feet per round as long as you and the pot are on the same plane of existence. It follows the shortest possible path, stopping when it moves to within 5 feet of you, and it bowls over or knocks down any objects or creatures in its path. A creature in its path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. When this magic pot comes into contact with an object or structure, it deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage. If the damage doesn't destroy or create a path through the object or structure, the pot continues to deal damage at the end of each round, carving a path through the obstacle.</p>
