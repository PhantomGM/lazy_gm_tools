<p>This armor is typically emblazoned or decorated with imagery of lions, bears, griffons, eagles, or other symbols of bravery and courage. While wearing this armor, your voice can be clearly heard by all friendly creatures within 300 feet of you if you so choose. Your voice doesn't carry in areas where sound is prevented, such as in the area of the silence spell. Each friendly creature that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against being frightened. You can use a bonus action to rally a friendly creature that can see or hear you. The target gains a +1 bonus to attack or damage rolls on its next turn. Once you have rallied a creature, you can't rally that creature again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
