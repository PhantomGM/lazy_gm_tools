<p>A murky liquid or smoke churns inside this small, glass globe. Typically, 1d3 primal dooms are found together. You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet of where the globe landed must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage. If at least one creature failed the saving throw, the primal essence of the Lower Planes within the globe coalesces into a fiend, depending on the type of globe. The fiend lasts for 1 minute and acts on its own, but it views you and your allies as its allies. Primal Doom of Anguish (Uncommon). This globe deals 2d6 psychic damage and summons a dretch or a lemure (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Pain (Rare). This globe deals 4d6 psychic damage and summons a barbed devil or vrock (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Rage (Very Rare). This globe deals 6d6 psychic damage and summons a bone devil or glabrezu (your choice) on a failed saving throw.</p>
