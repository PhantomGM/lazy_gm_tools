<p>This plate armor was magically crafted from plates of interlocking stone. Tiny rubies inlaid in the chest create a glittering mosaic of flames. When you fall while wearing this armor, you can tuck your knees against your chest and curl into a ball. While falling in this way, flames form around your body. You take half the usual falling damage when you hit the ground, and fire explodes from your form in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes fire damage equal to the falling damage you took, or half as much on a successful saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
