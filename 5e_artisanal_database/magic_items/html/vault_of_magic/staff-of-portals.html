<h1>Staff of Portals</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This iron-shod wooden staff is heavily worn, and it can be wielded as a quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all of its magic and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: arcane lock (2 charges), dimension door (4 charges), knock (2 charges), or passwall (5 charges).</p>
