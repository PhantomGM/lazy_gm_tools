<h1>Arrow of Grabbing</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Ammunition</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This arrow has a barbed head and is wound with a fine but strong thread that unravels as the arrow soars. If a creature takes damage from the arrow, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 damage and have the arrowhead lodged in its flesh. A creature grabbed by this arrow can't move farther away from you. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage and dislodging the arrow on a success. As an action, you can attempt to pull the grabbed creature up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you, forcing the creature to repeat the saving throw. If the creature fails, it moves up to 10 feet closer to you. If it succeeds, it takes 4d6 piercing damage and the arrow is dislodged.</p>
