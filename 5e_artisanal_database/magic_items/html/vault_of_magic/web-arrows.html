<h1>Web Arrows</h1>

<p>Carvings of spiderwebs decorate the arrowhead and shaft of these arrows, which always come in pairs. When you fire the arrows from a bow, they become the two anchor points for a 20-foot cube of thick, sticky webbing. Once you fire the first arrow, you must fire the second arrow within 1 minute. The arrows must land within 20 feet of each other, or the magic fails. The webs created by the arrows are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or enters them during its turn must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to break the creature free from the webbing by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>
