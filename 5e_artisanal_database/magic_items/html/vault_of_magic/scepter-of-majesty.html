<h1>Scepter of Majesty</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Rod</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>While holding this bejeweled, golden rod, you can use an action to cast the enthrall spell (save DC 15) from it, exhorting those in range to follow you and obey your commands. When you finish speaking, 1d6 creatures that failed their saving throw are affected as if by the dominate person spell. Each such creature treats you as its ruler, obeying your commands and automatically fighting in your defense should anyone attempt to harm you. If you are also attuned to and wearing a Headdress of Majesty (see page 146), your charmed subjects have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that attacked you or that cast an obvious spell on you within the last round. The scepter can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
