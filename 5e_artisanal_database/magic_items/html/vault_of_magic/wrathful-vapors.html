<p>Roiling vapors of red, orange, and black swirl in a frenzy of color inside a sealed glass bottle. As an action, you can open the bottle and empty its contents within 5 feet of you or throw the bottle up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. If you throw it, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottle as an improvised weapon. When you open or break the bottle, the smoke releases in a 20-foot-radius sphere that dissipates at the end of your next turn. A creature that isn't an undead or a construct that enters or starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with rage for 1 minute. On its turn, a creature overcome with rage must attack the creature nearest to it with whatever melee weapon it has on hand, moving up to its speed toward the target, if necessary. The raging creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
