<h1>Grasping Cloak</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>Made of strips of black leather, this cloak always shines as if freshly oiled. The strips writhe and grasp at nearby creatures. While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to grapple a creature no more than one size larger than you within 5 feet of you. The strips make the grapple attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target is grappled by the cloak, leaving your hands free to perform other tasks or actions that require both hands. However, you are still considered to be grappling a creature, limiting your movement as normal. The cloak can grapple only one creature at a time. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to aid you in grappling. If you do so, you have advantage on your next attack roll made to grapple a creature. While grappling a creature in this way, you have advantage on the contested check if a creature attempts to escape your grapple.</p>
