<p>This leathery mass of dried meat was once a humanoid heart, taken from an individual that died while experiencing great terror. You can use an action to whisper a command word and hurl the heart to the ground, where it revitalizes and begins to beat rapidly and loudly for 1 minute. Each creature withing 30 feet of the heart has disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. At the end of the duration, the heart bursts from the strain and is destroyed. The heart can be attacked and destroyed (AC 11; hp 3; resistance to bludgeoning damage). If the heart is destroyed before the end if its duration, each creature within 30 feet of the heart must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. This bugbear necromancer was once the henchman of an accomplished practitioner of the dark arts named Varrus. She started as a bodyguard and tough, but her keen intellect caught her master's attention. He eventually took her on as an apprentice. Moxug is fascinated with fear, and some say she doesn't eat but instead sustains herself on the terror of her victims. She eventually betrayed Varrus, sabotaging his attempt to become a lich, and luxuriated in his fear as he realized he would die rather than achieve immortality. According to rumor, the first craven's heart she crafted came from the body of her former master.</p>
