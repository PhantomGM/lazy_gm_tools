<p>This painting appears to be a well-rendered piece of scenery, devoid of subjects. You can spend 5 feet of movement to step into the painting. The painting then appears to be a portrait of you, against whatever background was already present. While in the painting, you are immobile unless you use a bonus action to exit the painting. Your senses still function, and you can use them as if you were in the portrait's space. You remain unharmed if the painting is damaged, but if it is destroyed, you are immediately shunted into the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
