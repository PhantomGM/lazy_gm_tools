<p>This hair pick has glittering teeth that slide easily into your hair, making your hair look perfectly coiffed and battle-ready. Though typically worn in hair, you can also wear the pick as a brooch or cloak clasp. While wearing this pick, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, the pick magically boosts your self-esteem and your confidence in your ability to overcome any challenge, making you immune to the frightened condition.</p>
