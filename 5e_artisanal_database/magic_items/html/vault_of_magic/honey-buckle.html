<p>While wearing this bear head-shaped belt buckle, you can use an action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a type of bear determined by the type of belt buckle you are wearing. While you are in the form of a bear, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The belt buckle can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. Black Honey Buckle (Uncommon). When you use this belt buckle to cast polymorph on yourself, you transform into a black bear. Brown Honey Buckle (Rare). When you use this belt buckle to cast polymorph on yourself, you transform into a brown bear. White Honey Buckle (Very Rare). When you use this belt buckle to cast polymorph on yourself, you transform into a polar bear.</p>
