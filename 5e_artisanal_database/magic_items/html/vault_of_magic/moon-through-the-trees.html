<p>This charm is comprised of six polished river stones bound into the shape of a star with glue made from the connective tissues of animals. The reflective surfaces of the stones shimmer with a magical iridescence. While you are within 20 feet of a living tree, you can use a bonus action to become invisible for 1 minute. While invisible, you can use a bonus action to become visible. If you do, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this charm's blinding feature for the next 24 hours.</p>
