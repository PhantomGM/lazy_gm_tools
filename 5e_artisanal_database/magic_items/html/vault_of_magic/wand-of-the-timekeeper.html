<h1>Wand of the Timekeeper</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wand</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This smoothly polished wooden wand is perfectly balanced in the hand. Its grip is wrapped with supple leather strips, and its length is decorated with intricate arcane symbols. When you use it while playing a drum, you have advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks. The wand has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. Erratic. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges to force one creature you can see to re-roll its initiative at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is unaffected. Synchronize. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to choose one creature you can see who has not taken its turn this round. That creature takes its next turn immediately after yours regardless of its turn in the Initiative order. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is unaffected.</p>
