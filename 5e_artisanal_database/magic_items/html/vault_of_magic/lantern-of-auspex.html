<h1>Lantern of Auspex</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This elaborate lantern is covered in simple glyphs, and its glass panels are intricately etched. Two of the panels depict a robed woman holding out a single hand, while the other two panels depict the same woman with her face partially obscured by a hand of cards. The lantern's magic is activated when it is lit, which requires an action. Once lit, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for 1 hour. You can use an action to open or close one of the glass panels on the lantern. If you open a panel, a vision of a random event that happened or that might happen plays out in the light's area. Closing a panel stops the vision. The visions are shown as nondescript smoky apparitions that play out silently in the lantern's light. At the GM's discretion, the vision might change to a different event each 1 minute that the panel remains open and the lantern lit. Once used, the lantern can't be used in this way again until 7 days have passed.</p>
