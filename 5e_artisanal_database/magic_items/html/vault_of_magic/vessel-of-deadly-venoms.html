<h1>Vessel of Deadly Venoms</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>

</ul>
<p>This small jug weighs 5 pounds and has a ceramic snake coiled around it. You can use an action to speak a command word to cause the vessel to produce poison, which pours from the snake's mouth. A poison created by the vessel must be used within 1 hour or it becomes inert. The word “blade” causes the snake to produce 1 dose of serpent venom, enough to coat a single weapon. The word “consume” causes the snake to produce 1 dose of assassin's blood, an ingested poison. The word “spit” causes the snake to spray a stream of poison at a creature you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. Once used, the vessel can't be used to create poison again until the next dawn.</p>
