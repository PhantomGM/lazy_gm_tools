<h1>Alabaster Salt Shaker</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>

</ul>
<p>This shaker is carved from purest alabaster in the shape of an owl. It is 7 inches tall and contains enough salt to flavor 25 meals. When the shaker is empty, it can't be refilled, and it becomes nonmagical. When you or another creature eat a meal salted by this shaker, you don't need to eat again for 48 hours, at which point the magic wears off. If you don't eat within 1 hour of the magic wearing off, you gain one level of exhaustion. You continue gaining one level of exhaustion for each additional hour you don't eat.</p>
