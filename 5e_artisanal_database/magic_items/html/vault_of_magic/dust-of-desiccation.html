<h1>Dust of Desiccation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This small packet contains soot-like dust. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to blow the choking dust from your palm, each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw can't speak until the end of its next turn as it chokes on the dust. Alternatively, you can use an action to throw the dust into the air, affecting yourself and each creature within 30 feet of you with the dust.</p>
