<h1>Staff of the Lantern Bearer</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>An iron hook is affixed to the top of this plain, wooden staff. While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast the light spell from it at will, but the light can emanate only from the staff 's hook. If a lantern hangs from the staff 's hook, you gain the following benefits while holding the staff: - You can control the light of the lantern, lighting or extinguishing it as a bonus action. The lantern must still have oil, if it requires oil to produce a flame.
- The lantern's flame can't be extinguished by wind or water.
- If you are a spellcaster, you can use the staff as a spellcasting focus. When you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage while using this staff as your spellcasting focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the spell's attack roll, or the spell's save DC increases by 1 (your choice).</p>
