<h1>Lightning Rod</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Rod</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This rod is made from the blackened wood of a lightning-struck tree and topped with a spike of twisted iron. It functions as a magic javelin that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you are immune to lightning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of you has resistance to lightning damage. The rod can hold up to 6 charges, but it has 0 charges when you first attune to it. Whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, the rod gains 1 charge. While the rod has 6 charges, you have resistance to lightning damage instead of immunity. The rod loses 1d6 charges daily at dawn.</p>
