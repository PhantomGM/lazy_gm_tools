<p>This wand is made from the bristles of a giant boar bound together with magical, silver thread. It weighs 1 pound and is 8 inches long. The wand has a strong boar musk scent to it, which is difficult to mask and is noticed by any creature within 10 feet of you that possesses the Keen Smell trait. The wand is comprised of 10 individual bristles, and as long as the wand has 1 bristle, it regrows 2 bristles daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use your action to remove bristles to cause one of the following effects. Ghostly Charge (3 bristles). You toss the bristles toward one creature you can see. A phantom giant boar charges 30 feet toward the creature. If the phantom’s path connects with the creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be knocked prone. Truffle (2 bristles). You plant the bristles in the ground to conjure up a magical truffle. Consuming the mushroom restores 2d8 hit points.</p>
