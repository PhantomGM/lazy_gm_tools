<h1>Efreeti Bottle</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.1 SRD (D&amp;D 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
<p>The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.</p>

<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>01-10</td>
<td>The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11-90</td>
<td>The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>91-100</td>
<td>The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>
