This silver ring is inscribed with tiny runes that shimmer with magical energy. While wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Curse**. This ring is cursed. When you teleport using this ring, roll a d20. On a 1, you teleport to a random unoccupied space within 30 feet of your original location instead of your intended destination.
