You create a surge of raw magical energy that disrupts a spell being cast. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails and has no effect, and the caster takes 2d6 force damage as magical energy backlashes through them. On a successful save, the spell is cast normally, but the caster takes half damage.

If the spell being cast is of 3rd level or higher, you must make a spellcasting ability check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a failed check, arcane feedback has no effect.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
