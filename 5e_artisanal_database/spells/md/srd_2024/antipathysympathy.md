As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save: Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
