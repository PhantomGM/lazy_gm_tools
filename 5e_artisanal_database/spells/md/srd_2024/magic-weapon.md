You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3â€“5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.
