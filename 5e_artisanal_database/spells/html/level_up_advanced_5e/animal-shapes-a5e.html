<p>You transform the bodies of creatures into beasts without altering their minds. Each target transforms into a Large or smaller beast with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. Each target may have the same or a different form than other targets.</p>
<p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform targets into new forms, gaining new hit points when they do so.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target's game statistics (including its hit points) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast excepting its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can't speak or cast spells. The target's gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target's form has no effect until it leaves the form.</p>
<p>When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell's effect on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>
