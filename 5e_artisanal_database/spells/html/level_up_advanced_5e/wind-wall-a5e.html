<h1>Wind Wall</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 3 Evocation</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground.</p>
<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gases (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the area fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and siege engine attacks are unaffected).</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
