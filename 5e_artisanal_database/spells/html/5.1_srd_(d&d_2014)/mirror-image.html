<p>Three illusionary duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the end of the spell, duplicates move with you and imitate your actions, swapping their position so that it is impossible to determine which image is real. You can use your action to dispel the illusory duplicates. Whenever a creature is targeting you with an attack during the duration of the spell, roll 1d20 to determine if the attack does not target rather one of your duplicates. If you have three duplicates, you need 6 or more on your throw to lead the target of the attack to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you need 8 or more. With one duplicate, you need 11 or more. The CA of a duplicate is 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, it is destroyed. A duplicate may be destroyed not just an attack on key. It ignores other damage and effects. The spell ends if the three duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this fate if she can not see if it relies on a different meaning as vision, such as blind vision, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with clear vision.</p>
