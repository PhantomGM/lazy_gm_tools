<h1>Fey Crown</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 5 abjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Warlock</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (five flowers of different colors)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>By channeling the ancient wards of the Seelie Court, you create a crown of five flowers on your head. While wearing this crown, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects and are immune to being charmed. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself). Until the end of its next turn, the chosen creature is invisible and has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Each time a chosen creature becomes invisible, one of the blossoms in the crown closes. After the last of the blossoms closes, the spell ends at the start of your next turn and the crown disappears.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the crown can have one additional flower for each slot level above 5th. One additional flower is required as a material component for each additional flower in the crown.</p>
