### Reactions

- **Protector's Parry:** When a friendly creature the guard can see within 5 feet of it is the target of an attack, the guard can interpose its weapon between the creature and the attacker. The friendly creature adds 2 to its AC against that attack. To use this reaction, the guard must be able to see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
