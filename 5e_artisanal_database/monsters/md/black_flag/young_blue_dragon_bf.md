- **Charged Hide:** When the blue dragon hasn't exhaled its Lightning Breath, the electric charge builds up across its body.

- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10+5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage.
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 DEX save, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
