### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the boar takes 4 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.
