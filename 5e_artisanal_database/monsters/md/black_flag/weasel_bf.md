### Actions

- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 3 (1d4+1) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the weasel can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 5 pounds, can fit in one hand, isn't a weapon, and isn't wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. For example, a weasel could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature's shirt or armor.
