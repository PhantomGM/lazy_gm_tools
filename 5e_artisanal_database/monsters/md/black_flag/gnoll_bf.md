### Special Abilities

- **Heightened Smell:** The gnoll's Perception is 15 when perceiving by smell.

### Actions

- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage.
- **Spear:** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Bonus Actions

- **Taunting Bark:** The gnoll lets out a high-pitched laugh and taunts one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 12 CHA save. On a failure, a creature takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage and must spend its next turn moving up to its speed toward the gnoll and make one attack against the gnoll.

### Reactions

- **Rampage:** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 HP, it can move up to half its speed and make one Bite attack. If it does, attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
