***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If the Nameless King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Arcane Weaver.*** The Nameless King can change the damage type of any of his spells or attacks to acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant damage at will.

***Aura of Death.*** The first time a creature moves within 30 feet of the Nameless King or starts their turn there, they take 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. Any creature who restores hit points while within 30 feet of the Nameless King restores only half the expected number of hit points.

***Spellcasting.*** The Nameless King is a master of magic. He knows and can cast any spell in existence, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The following are some of the Nameless King's commonly used spells, any of which he can replace with any known spell of the same level:

At will: *alter self*, *counterspell*, *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, *gaseous form*, *invisibility*, *light*, *mage hand*, *magic circle*, *major image*, *message*, *prestidigitation*, *shield*

3/day each: *disintegrate*, *mind blank*, *plane shift*, *polymorph*, *telekinesis*, *wish*

#### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Nameless King makes two Claw of Ibraxus attacks and uses Hurl Through the Arches.

***Claw of Ibraxus.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 36 (8d8) force damage.

***Hurl Through the Arches.*** One creature within 120 feet of the Nameless King who the Nameless King can see must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is hurled through a temporary archway created by the Nameless King, takes 44 (8d10) force damage, and disappears until the start of their next turn. The creature reappears in an unoccupied space of the Nameless King's choosing within 60 feet of the Nameless King. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not disappear.

***Twin Eyes of Death (1/Day).*** Two creatures within 120 feet of the Nameless King who the Nameless King can see must each make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies.

#### Bonus Actions

***Curse of Arkus.*** One creature within 120 feet of the Nameless King has disadvantage on saving throws until the start of the Nameless King's next turn.

***Step Through the Arch.*** The Nameless King teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 90 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

#### Legendary Actions

The Nameless King can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Nameless King regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Claw of Ibraxus.** The Nameless King makes a Claw of Ibraxus attack.

**Elemental Apocalypse (Costs 3 Actions).** If the Nameless King is at half his hit points or fewer, he creates a burst of energy in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on his position. Each creature of the Nameless King's choice within that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 42 (12d6) damage of a type chosen by the Nameless King and 42 (12d6) damage of a second chosen type, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant damage. A creature takes half as much damage on a successful save.

**Hurl Through the Arches (Costs 2 Actions).** The Nameless King uses Hurl Through the Arches.
