1/day each: *banishment, command, dispel magic, hold person, lesser restoration, greater restoration, resurrection*

#### Actions

***Fang of the Blood Lord.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Blood Lord's Curse.*** Brother Cavel targets a creature within 120 feet who he can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn.

#### Bonus Actions

***Aura of the Dead.*** While conscious, Brother Cavel can surround himself with the screaming specters of his victims or suppress that manifestation. While the specters are active, whenever a creature hostile to Brother Cavel moves within 15 feet of him for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
