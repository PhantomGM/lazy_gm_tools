***Legendary Resistance (6/Day).*** If Ibraxus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. Each time Ibraxus uses his legendary resistance, one of his eyes goes black. If all six of his eyes go black, Ibraxus is blinded and loses his darkvision and truesight.

***Aura of the Poisoned Depths.*** Whenever a creature willingly moves within 30 feet of Ibraxus for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, Ibraxus can choose for that creature to take 22 (5d8) acid damage and 22 (5d8) poison damage.

***Molecular Transportation (3/Day).*** If Ibraxus starts his turn and is unable to move freely or take his Multiattack action, his body (including his pyramidal base) disassembles, then reassembles in an unoccupied space within 90 feet of his original location. Any effects that prevented Ibraxus from moving or using his Multiattack action are ended on him.

#### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Ibraxus makes two Spectral Scourge attacks and one Scepter of Vyse attack.

***Spectral Scourge.*** *Melee Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 40 (6d10 +7) psychic damage, and the target can't use reactions until the start of Ibraxus's next turn.

***Scepter of Vyse.*** *Melee Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 15 ft. or range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 62 (10d10 +7) necrotic damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies.

#### Bonus Actions

***Arcane Disassembly.*** One creature within 120 feet of Ibraxus gains vulnerability to a damage type of Ibraxus's choice until the start of Ibraxus's next turn. If the target had resistance to that damage type, they instead lose that resistance. If they had immunity to that damage type, they instead have resistance to the damage type.

***Pyramid Teleportation.*** Ibraxus can teleport to any unoccupied space within 90 feet.

#### Legendary Actions

Ibraxus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Ibraxus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Spectral Scourge.** Ibraxus makes a Spectral Scourge attack.

**Scepter's Call (Costs 2 Actions).** Ibraxus makes a Scepter of Vyse attack. On a hit, the target can be teleported up to 120 feet to a space within 5 feet of Ibraxus.
