<h1>Magic Items (V)</h1>
<h3>Vicious Weapon</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any), rare</em></p>
<p>When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this magic weapon, your critical hit deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.</p>
<h3>Vorpal Sword</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p>
<p>When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p>
