## Using the 5eADB

### Run it locally in your own web browser

Click on "index.html" in the top level directory of the 5eADB. It should launch in your default web browser and you can access all features there just like you were navigating it on the web.

### Copy "md" directories to your Obsidian Vault

Navigate down the folders under the root directory to find "md" directories for any given ruleset or dataset. Copy those md directories to your Obsidian vault directory to copy over all the markdown files for those sources. Rename them so you can see what they are in your vault.

### Host it on your own private web server

Copy the whole directory and all subdirectories to the directory you use to host HTML files. There is no server-side code for the 5eADB â€“ it's all HTML with some javascript and markdown files.

### Licensing

See the "licensing.html" file in the root directory for licensing information.
