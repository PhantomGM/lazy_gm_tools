# Lazy GM Tools

This repository contains several game master tools for tabletop roleplaying games, particularly for, but not exclusively for, 5e games.

In this repository you'll find:

**The Lazy GM's Random Generator (lazy_gm_generator_perchance_input.txt)**. A Perchance input for building a random generator in HTML. You can use the input yourself in Perchance or use the HTML version directly.

**The Forge of Foes Stat Tool (fof_stats.html)**. A single-page HTML file to help you generate 5e statistics for 5e monsters using the material found in *[Forge of Foes](https://shop.slyflourish.com/collections/the-lazy-dungeon-master-series/products/forge-of-foes)*.

**The 5e Artisanal Monster Database (/5e_monsters/)**. A monster database built from [Open5e](https://open5e.com) in HTML and markdown, all set up to run locally through your own browser.

**The Dyson Map Selector (/dyson_maps/)**. A tool to find maps from a library of commercially-licensed [Dyson Logos](https://dysonlogos.blog) maps. Please consider joining [Dyson's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dysonlogos/).

**Forge of Foes Stats for Espanso (forge_of_foes_for_espanso.yml)**. A set of YAML instructions compatible with [espanso](https://espanso.org/).

All of these fine tools are made possible by the generous support of the [Sly Flourish Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/slyflourish). If you are not a patron, please consider joining!
