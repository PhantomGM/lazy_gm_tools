  <strong>Aberrant Agreement</strong> (rare), pg 47. This long scroll bears strange runes and seals of eldritch powers. When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.
  <strong>Accursed Idol</strong> (uncommon), pg 104. Carved from a curious black stone of unknown origin, this small totem is fashioned in the macabre likeness of a Great Old One. While attuned to the idol and holding it, you gain the following benefits: - You can speak, read, and write Deep Speech. - You can use an action to speak the idol's command word and send otherworldly spirits to whisper in the minds of up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. If a target dies from this damage or while frightened, the otherworldly spirits within the idol are temporarily sated, and you don't suffer the effects of the idol's Otherworldly Whispers property at the next dusk. Once used, this property of the idol can't be used again until the next dusk. - You can use an action to cast the augury spell from the idol. The idol can't be used this way again until the next dusk.
  <strong>Agile Armor</strong> (common), pg 11. This magically enhanced armor is less bulky than its nonmagical version. While wearing a suit of medium agile armor, the maximum Dexterity modifier you can add to determine your Armor Class is 3, instead of 2. While wearing a suit of heavy agile armor, the maximum Dexterity modifier you can add to determine your Armor Class is 1, instead of 0.
  <strong>Air Seed</strong> (uncommon), pg 105. This plum-sized, nearly spherical sandstone is imbued with a touch of air magic. Typically, 1d4 + 4 air seeds are found together. You can use an action to throw the seed up to 60 feet. The seed explodes on impact and is destroyed. When it explodes, the seed releases a burst of fresh, breathable air, and it disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed. Each suffocating or choking creature within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes. If you break the seed while underwater, each creature within a 10-foot radius of where you broke the seed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes.
  <strong>Akaasit Blade</strong> (rare), pg 11. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This dagger is crafted from the arm blade of a defeated Akaasit (see Tome of Beasts 2). You can use an action to activate a small measure of prescience within the dagger for 1 minute. If you are attacked by a creature you can see within 5 feet of you while this effect is active, you can use your reaction to make one attack with this dagger against the attacker. If your attack hits, the dagger loses its prescience, and its prescience can't be activated again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Alabaster Salt Shaker</strong> (rare), pg 105. This shaker is carved from purest alabaster in the shape of an owl. It is 7 inches tall and contains enough salt to flavor 25 meals. When the shaker is empty, it can't be refilled, and it becomes nonmagical. When you or another creature eat a meal salted by this shaker, you don't need to eat again for 48 hours, at which point the magic wears off. If you don't eat within 1 hour of the magic wearing off, you gain one level of exhaustion. You continue gaining one level of exhaustion for each additional hour you don't eat.
  <strong>Alchemical Lantern</strong> (uncommon), pg 105. This hooded lantern has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While the lantern is lit, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cause the lantern to spit gooey alchemical fire at a creature you can see in the lantern's bright light. The lantern makes its attack roll with a +5 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
  <strong>Alembic of Unmaking</strong> (very rare), pg 105. This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes emit bright, amethyst sparks. If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won't physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a cloak) can't be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm. An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item per 24 hours.
  <strong>Almanac of Common Wisdom</strong> (common), pg 105. The dog-eared pages of this thick, weathered tome contain useful advice, facts, and statistical information on a wide range of topics. The topics change to match information relevant to the area where it is currently located. If you spend a short rest consulting the almanac, you treat your proficiency bonus as 1 higher when making any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill checks to discover, recall, or cite information about local events, locations, or creatures for the next 4 hours. For example, this almanac's magic can help you recall and find the location of a city's oldest tavern, but its magic won't help you notice a thug hiding in an alley near the tavern.
  <strong>Amulet of Memory</strong> (rare), pg 106. Made of gold or silver, this spherical locket is engraved with two cresting waves facing away from each other while bound in a twisted loop. It preserves a memory to be reexperienced later. While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to speak the command word and open the locket. The open locket stores what you see and experience for up to 10 minutes. You can shut the locket at any time (no action required), stopping the memory recording. Opening the locket with the command word again overwrites the contained memory. While a memory is stored, you or another creature can touch the locket to experience the memory from the beginning. Breaking contact ends the memory early. In addition, you have advantage on any skill check related to details or knowledge of the stored memory. If you die while wearing the amulet, it preserves you. Your body is affected by the gentle repose spell until the amulet is removed or until you are restored to life. In addition, at the moment of your death, you can store any memory into the amulet. A creature touching the amulet perceives the memory stored there even after your death. Attuning to an amulet of memory removes any prior memories stored in it.
  <strong>Amulet of Sustaining Health</strong> (uncommon), pg 106. While wearing this amulet, you need to eat and drink only once every 7 days. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause you to suffer a level of exhaustion.
  <strong>Amulet of Whirlwinds</strong> (rare), pg 106. This amulet is strung on a brass necklace and holds a piece of djinn magic. The amulet has 9 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to create a whirlwind on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The whirlwind is a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air that lasts as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature other than you that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. You can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if you lose sight of it. A creature within 5 feet of the whirlwind can pull a creature out of it by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeding. A restrained creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the whirlwind. When all of the amulet's charges are expended, the amulet becomes a nonmagical piece of jewelry worth 50 gp.
  <strong>Amulet of the Oracle</strong> (rare), pg 106. When you finish a long rest while wearing this amulet, you can choose one cantrip from the cleric spell list. You can cast that cantrip from the amulet at will, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for it.
  <strong>Anchor of Striking</strong> (rare), pg 11. This small rusty iron anchor feels sturdy in spite of its appearance. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic war pick. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target is wrapped in ethereal golden chains that extend from the bottom of the anchor. As an action, the chained target can make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check, freeing itself from the chains on a success. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the chains to disappear, freeing the target. The chains are constructed of magical force and can't be damaged, though they can be destroyed with a disintegrate spell. While the target is wrapped in these chains, you and the target can't move further than 50 feet from each other.
  <strong>Angelic Earrings</strong> (uncommon), pg 106. These earrings feature platinum loops from which hang bronzed claws from a Chamrosh (see Tome of Beasts 2), freely given by the angelic hound. While wearing these earrings, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if a creature is lying or if it has an evil alignment. If you cast detect evil and good while wearing these earrings, the range increases to 60 feet, and the spell lasts 10 minutes without requiring concentration.
  <strong>Angry Hornet</strong> (uncommon), pg 11. This black ammunition has yellow fletching or yellow paint. When you fire this magic ammunition, it makes an angry buzzing sound, and it multiplies in flight. As it flies, 2d4 identical pieces of ammunition magically appear around it, all speeding toward your target. Roll separate attack rolls for each additional arrow or bullet. Duplicate ammunition disappears after missing or after dealing its damage. If the angry hornet and all its duplicates miss, the angry hornet remains magical and can be fired again, otherwise it is destroyed.
  <strong>Animated Abacus</strong> (common), pg 106. If you speak a mathematical equation within 5 feet of this abacus, it calculates the equation and displays the solution. If you are touching the abacus, it calculates only the equations you speak, ignoring all other spoken equations.
  <strong>Animated Chain Mail</strong> (rare), pg 12. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can use an action to cause parts of the armor to unravel into long, animated chains. While the chains are active, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and your AC is reduced by 2. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the chains, returning the armor to normal.
  <strong>Ankh of Aten</strong> (rare), pg 107. This golden ankh is about 12 inches long and has 5 charges. While holding the ankh by the loop, you can expend 1 charge as an action to fire a beam of brilliant sunlight in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line from the end. Each creature caught in the line must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes a5d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn't blinded. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. The ankh regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Anointing Mace</strong> (uncommon), pg 12. Also called an anointing gada, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the ornately decorated head of the mace holds a reservoir perforated with small holes. As an action, you can fill the reservoir with a single potion or vial of liquid, such as holy water or alchemist's fire. You can press a button on the haft of the weapon as a bonus action, which opens the holes. If you hit a target with the weapon while the holes are open, the weapon deals damage as normal and the target suffers the effects of the liquid. For example, an anointing mace filled with holy water deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage if it hits a fiend or undead. After you press the button and make an attack roll, the liquid is expended, regardless if your attack hits.
  <strong>Apron of the Eager Artisan</strong> (common), pg 107. Created by dwarven artisans, this leather apron has narrow pockets, which hold one type of artisan's tools. If you are wearing the apron and you spend 10 minutes contemplating your next crafting project, the tools in the apron magically change to match those best suited to the task. Once you have changed the tools available, you can't change them again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Arcanaphage Stone</strong> (rare), pg 108. Similar to the rocks found in a bird's gizzard, this smooth stone helps an Arcanaphage (see Creature Codex) digest magic. While you hold or wear the stone, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.
  <strong>Armor of Cushioning</strong> (uncommon), pg 12. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage. In addition, you can use a reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your level.
  <strong>Armor of Spite</strong> (rare), pg 12. Unholy glyphs engraved on this black iron magic armor burn with a faint, orange light. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. At the start of your turn, you can choose to allow attack rolls against you to have advantage. If you do, the glyphs shed dim light in a 5-foot radius, and you can use a reaction when a creature hits you with an attack to force the attacker to take necrotic damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
  <strong>Armor of Warding</strong> (uncommon, rare, very rare), pg 13. Charms and wards made of claws, feathers, scales, or similar objects adorn this armor, which is etched with the likenesses of the creatures that contributed the adornments. The armor provides protection against a specific type of foe, indicated by its adornments. While wearing this armor, you have a bonus to AC against attacks from creatures of the type the armor wards against. The bonus is determined by its rarity. The armor provides protection against one of the following creature types: aberration, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead.
  <strong>Armor of the Leaf</strong> (uncommon), pg 12. This suit of armor always has a forest or leaf motif and is usually green or brown in color. While wearing this armor in forest terrain, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You can use an action to transform the armor into a cloud of swirling razor-sharp leaves, and each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 slashing damage. For 1 minute, the cloud of leaves spreads out in a 10-foot radius from you, making the area lightly obscured for creatures other than you. The cloud moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the cloud and ends the effect. While the armor is transformed, you don't gain a base Armor Class from the armor. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Armor of the Ngobou</strong> (rare), pg 13. This thick and rough armor is made from the hide of a Ngobou (see Tome of Beasts), an aggressive, ox-sized dinosaur known to threaten elephants of the plains. The horns and tusks of the dinosaur are worked into the armor as spiked shoulder pads. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have a magical sense for elephants. You automatically detect if an elephant has passed within 90 feet of your location within the last 24 hours, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to find elephants.
  <strong>Arrow of Grabbing</strong> (very rare), pg 13. This arrow has a barbed head and is wound with a fine but strong thread that unravels as the arrow soars. If a creature takes damage from the arrow, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 damage and have the arrowhead lodged in its flesh. A creature grabbed by this arrow can't move farther away from you. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage and dislodging the arrow on a success. As an action, you can attempt to pull the grabbed creature up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you, forcing the creature to repeat the saving throw. If the creature fails, it moves up to 10 feet closer to you. If it succeeds, it takes 4d6 piercing damage and the arrow is dislodged.
  <strong>Arrow of Unpleasant Herbs</strong> (uncommon), pg 13. This arrow's tip is filled with magically preserved, poisonous herbs. When a creature takes damage from the arrow, the arrowhead breaks, releasing the herbs. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it retches and reels from the poison.
  <strong>Ash of the Ebon Birch</strong> (uncommon), pg 47. This salve is created by burning bark from a rare ebon birch tree then mixing that ash with oil and animal blood to create a cerise pigment used to paint yourself or another creature with profane protections. Painting the pigment on a creature takes 1 minute, and you can choose to paint a specific sigil or smear the pigment on a specific part of the creature's body.
  <strong>Ashes of the Fallen</strong> (rare), pg 108. Found in a small packet, this coarse, foul-smelling black dust is made from the powdered remains of a celestial. Each packet of the substance contains enough ashes for one use. You can use an action to throw the dust in a 15-foot cone. Each spellcaster in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for 1 hour or until the curse is ended with a remove curse spell or similar magic. Creatures that don't cast spells are unaffected. A cursed spellcaster must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw each time it casts a spell. On a success, the spell is cast normally. On a failure, the spellcaster casts a different, randomly chosen spell of the same level or lower from among the spellcaster's prepared or known spells. If the spellcaster has no suitable spells available, no spell is cast.
  <strong>Ashwood Wand</strong> (common), pg 71. You can use this wand as a spellcasting focus. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell that deals fire damage while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals 1 extra fire damage. If you expend 1 of the wand's charges during the casting, the spell deals 1d4 + 1 extra fire damage instead.
  <strong>Asp's Kiss</strong> (legendary), pg 13. This haladie features two short, slightly curved blades attached to a single hilt with a short, blue-sheened spike on the hand guard. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to this sword, you have immunity to poison damage, and, when you take the Dash action, the extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed. When you use the Attack action with this sword, you can make one attack with its hand guard spike (treat as a dagger) as a bonus action. You can use an action to cause indigo poison to coat the blades of this sword. The poison remains for 1 minute or until two attacks using the blade of this weapon hit one or more creatures. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the poison damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The sword can't be used this way again until the next dawn. When you kill a creature with this weapon, it sheds a single, blue tear as it takes its last breath.
  <strong>Aurochs Bracers</strong> (uncommon), pg 108. These bracers have the graven image of a bull's head on them. Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these bracers. It has no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher. In addition, when you use the Attack action to shove a creature, you have advantage on the Strength (Athletics) check.
  <strong>Axe of the Ancients</strong> (uncommon), pg 14. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you draw this weapon, you can use a bonus action to cast the thaumaturgy spell from it. You can have only one of the spell's effects active at a time when you cast it in this way.
  <strong>Baba Yaga's Cinderskull</strong> (rare), pg 108. Warm to the touch, this white, dry skull radiates dim, orange light from its eye sockets in a 30-foot radius. While attuned to the skull, you only require half of the daily food and water a creature of your size and type normally requires. In addition, you can withstand extreme temperatures indefinitely, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against extreme temperatures.
  <strong>Badger Hide</strong> (uncommon), pg 14. While wearing this hairy, black and white armor, you have a burrowing speed of 20 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
  <strong>Bag of Bramble Beasts</strong> (uncommon), pg 108. This ordinary bag, made from green cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, spiky object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound. You can use an action to pull the spiky object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a 1d8 and consulting the below table. The creature is a bramble version (see sidebar) of the beast listed in the table. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three spiky objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn. Alternatively, one willing animal companion or familiar can be placed in the bag for 1 week. A non-beast animal companion or familiar that is placed in the bag is treated as if it had been placed into a bag of holding and can be removed from the bag at any time. A beast animal companion or familiar disappears once placed in the bag, and the bag's magic is dormant until the week is up. At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish. The creature retains its status as an animal companion or familiar after its transformation and can choose to activate or deactivate its Thorn Body trait as a bonus action. A transformed familiar can be re-summoned with the find familiar spell. Once the bag has been used to change an animal companion or familiar into a bramble creature, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical bag. | 1d8 | Creature | | --- | ------------ | | 1 | Weasel | | 2 | Giant rat | | 3 | Badger | | 4 | Boar | | 5 | Panther | | 6 | Giant badger | Only a beast can become a bramble creature. It retains all its statistics except as noted below.
  <strong>Bag of Traps</strong> (rare), pg 109. Anyone reaching into this apparently empty bag feels a small coin, which resembles no known currency. Removing the coin and placing or tossing it up to 20 feet creates a random mechanical trap that remains for 10 minutes or until discharged or disarmed, whereupon it disappears. The coin returns to the bag only after the trap disappears. You may draw up to 10 traps from the bag each week. The GM has the statistics for mechanical traps.
  <strong>Bagpipes of Battle</strong> (uncommon), pg 109. Inspire friends and strike fear in the hearts of your enemies with the drone of valor and the shrill call of martial might! You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these bagpipes. You can use an action to play them and create a fearsome and inspiring tune. Each ally within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune gains a d12 Bardic Inspiration die for 10 minutes. Each creature within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune and that is hostile to you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A hostile creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is within 5 feet of you or your ally. A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, the bagpipes can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Baleful Wardrums</strong> (uncommon), pg 109. You must be proficient with percussion instruments to use these drums. The drums have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create a baleful rumble. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next weapon or spell attack roll. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these drums for 24 hours. The drum regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Band of Iron Thorns</strong> (rare), pg 110. This black iron armband bristles with long, needle-sharp iron thorns. When you attune to the armband, the thorns bite into your flesh. The armband doesn't function unless the thorns pierce your skin and are able to reach your blood. While wearing the band, after you roll a saving throw but before the GM reveals if the roll is a success or failure, you can use your reaction to expend one Hit Die. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to your saving throw.
  <strong>Band of Restraint</strong> (uncommon), pg 110. These simple leather straps are nearly unbreakable when used as restraints. If you spend 1 minute tying a Small or Medium creature's limbs with these straps, the creature is restrained (escape DC 17) until it escapes or until you speak a command word to release the straps. While restrained by these straps, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks.
  <strong>Bandana of Brachiation</strong> (uncommon), pg 110. While wearing this bright yellow bandana, you have a climbing speed of 30 feet, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to jump over obstacles, to land on your feet, and to land safely on a breakable or unstable surface, such as a tree branch or rotting wooden rafters.
  <strong>Bandana of Bravado</strong> (uncommon), pg 110. While wearing this bright red bandana, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and on saving throws against being frightened.
  <strong>Banner of the Fortunate</strong> (uncommon), pg 110. While holding this banner aloft with one hand, you can use an action to inspire creatures nearby. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can see the banner has advantage on its next attack roll. The banner can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Battle Standard of Passage</strong> (uncommon), pg 110. This battle standard hangs from a 4-foot-long pole and bears the colors and heraldry of a long-forgotten nation. You can use an action to plant the pole in the ground, causing the standard to whip and wave as if in a breeze. Choose up to six creatures within 30 feet of the standard, which can include yourself. Nonmagical difficult terrain costs the creatures you chose no extra movement. In addition, each creature you chose can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. The standard stops waving and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the pole from the ground. The standard can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bead of Exsanguination</strong> (rare), pg 110. This small, black bead measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weights an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 1 beads of exsanguination are found together. When thrown, the bead absorbs hit points from creatures near its impact site, damaging them. A bead can store up to 50 hit points at a time. When found, a bead contains 2d10 stored hit points. You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of where the bead landed must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The bead stores hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The bead turns from black to crimson the more hit points are stored in it. If the bead absorbs 50 hit points or more, it explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of the bead when it explodes must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you are holding the bead, you can use a bonus action to determine if the bead is below or above half its maximum stored hit points. If you hold and study the bead over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, you know exactly how many hit points are stored in the bead.
  <strong>Bear Paws</strong> (uncommon), pg 111. These hand wraps are made of flexible beeswax that ooze sticky honey. While wearing these gloves, you have advantage on grapple checks. In addition, creatures grappled by you have disadvantage on any checks made to escape your grapple.
  <strong>Bed of Spikes</strong> (rare), pg 111. This wide, wooden plank holds hundreds of two-inch long needle-like spikes. When you finish a long rest on the bed, you have resistance to piercing damage and advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration on spells you cast for 8 hours or until you finish a short or long rest. Once used, the bed can't be used again until the next dusk.
  <strong>Belt of the Wilds</strong> (uncommon), pg 111. This thin cord is made from animal sinew. While wearing the cord, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks left by beasts, giants, and humanoids. While wearing the belt, you can use a bonus action to speak the belt's command word. If you do, you leave tracks of the animal of your choice instead of your regular tracks. These tracks can be those of a Large or smaller beast with a CR of 1 or lower, such as a pony, rabbit, or lion. If you repeat the command word, you end the effect.
  <strong>Berserker's Kilt</strong> (varies), pg 111. This kilt is made from bear, elk, or wolf fur. While wearing this kilt, your Unarmored Defense increases by 1, and you gain additional benefits while raging, depending on the type of kilt you are wearing. Bear Fur (Very Rare). This kilt empowers your rage with the vigor of a bear. When you enter a rage, you gain 20 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last until your rage ends. Elk Fur (Rare). This kilt empowers your rage with the nimble ferocity of an elk. While raging, if you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type. Wolf Fur (Uncommon). This kilt empowers your rage with the speed of a wolf. While raging, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
  <strong>Big Dipper</strong> (rare), pg 71. This wooden rod is topped with a ridged ball. The rod has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the rod's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod melts into a pool of nonmagical honey and is destroyed. Anytime you expend 1 or more charges for this rod's properties, the ridged ball flows with delicious, nonmagical honey for 1 minute.
  <strong>Binding Oath</strong> (very rare), pg 48. This lengthy scroll is the testimony of a pious individual's adherence to their faith. The author has emphatically rewritten these claims many times, and its two slim, metal rollers are wrapped in yards of parchment. When you attune to the item, you rewrite certain passages to align with your own religious views. You can use an action to throw the scroll at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, the scroll unfurls and wraps around the creature. The target is restrained until you take a bonus action to command the scroll to release the creature. If you command it to release the creature or if you miss with the attack, the scroll curls back into a rolled-up scroll. If the restrained target's alignment is the opposite of yours along the law/chaos or good/evil axis, you can use a bonus action to cause the writing to blaze with light, dealing 2d6 radiant damage to the target. A creature, including the restrained target, can use an action to make a DC 17 Strength check to tear apart the scroll. On a success, the scroll is destroyed. Such an attempt causes the writing to blaze with light, dealing 2d6 radiant damage to both the creature making the attempt and the restrained target, whether or not the attempt is successful. Alternatively, the restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 17 Dexterity check to slip free of the scroll. This action also triggers the damage effect, but it doesn't destroy the scroll. Once used, the scroll can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bituminous Orb</strong> (very rare), pg 111. A tarlike substance leaks continually from this orb, which radiates a cloying darkness and emanates an unnatural chill. While attuned to the orb, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, you have immunity to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal radiant damage. This orb has 6 charges and regains 1d6 daily at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as an action to lob some of the orb's viscous darkness at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the creature is blinded and takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and you can use a bonus action to move the grappled creature up to 20 feet in any direction. You can't move the creature more than 60 feet away from the orb. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 2 charges and crush the grappled creature. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can end the grapple at any time (no action required). The orb's power can grapple only one creature at a time.
  <strong>Black Dragon Oil</strong> (rare), pg 48. The viscous green-black oil within this magical ceramic pot bubbles slightly. The pot's stone stopper is sealed with greasy, dark wax. The pot contains 5 ounces of pure black dragon essence, obtained by slowly boiling the dragon in its own acidic secretions. You can use an action to apply 1 ounce of the oil to a weapon or single piece of ammunition. The next attack made with that weapon or ammunition deals an extra 2d8 acid damage to the target. A creature that takes the acid damage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of its next turn or be burned for an extra 2d8 acid damage.
  <strong>Black Phial</strong> (uncommon), pg 112. This black stone phial has a tightly fitting stopper and 3 charges. As an action, you can fill the phial with blood taken from a living, or recently deceased (dead no longer than 1 minute), humanoid and expend 1 charge. When you do so, the black phial transforms the blood into a potion of greater healing. A creature who drinks this potion must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The phial regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the phial's last charge, roll a d20: 1d20. On a 1, the phial crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
  <strong>Black and White Daggers</strong> (rare), pg 14. These matched daggers are identical except for the stones set in their pommels. One pommel is chalcedony (opaque white), the other is obsidian (opaque black). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with both magic weapons. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the white dagger to attack a monstrosity, and it increases to +3 when you use the black dagger to attack an undead. When you hit a monstrosity or undead with both daggers in the same turn, that creature takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage from the second attack.
  <strong>Blackguard's Blade</strong> (common), pg 14. You have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon against a target if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, and it has no allies within 5 feet of it.
  <strong>Blacktooth</strong> (legendary), pg 72. This black ivory, rune-carved wand has 7 charges. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the guiding bolt spell from it, using an attack bonus of +7. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
  <strong>Blade of Petals</strong> (rare), pg 14. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This brightly-colored shortsword is kept in a wooden scabbard with eternally blooming flowers. The blade is made of dull green steel, and its pommel is fashioned from hard rosewood. As a bonus action, you can conjure a flowery mist which fills a 20-foot area around you with pleasant-smelling perfume. The scent dissipates after 1 minute. A creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. A creature can't be charmed this way more than once every 24 hours.
  <strong>Blade of the Dervish</strong> (rare), pg 15. This magic scimitar is empowered by your movements. For every 10 feet you move before making an attack, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of that attack, and the scimitar deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage if the attack hits (maximum of +3 and 3d6). In addition, if you use the Dash action and move within 5 feet of a creature, you can attack that creature as a bonus action. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.
  <strong>Blade of the Temple Guardian</strong> (uncommon), pg 15. This simple but elegant shortsword is a magic weapon. When you are wielding it and use the Flurry of Blows class feature, you can make your bonus attacks with the sword rather than unarmed strikes. If you deal damage to a creature with this weapon and reduce it to 0 hit points, you absorb some of its energy, regaining 1 expended ki point.
  <strong>Blasphemous Writ</strong> (uncommon), pg 48. The Infernal runes inscribed upon this vellum scroll radiate a faint, crimson glow. When you use this spell scroll of command, the save DC is 15 instead of 13, and you can also affect targets that are undead or that don't understand your language.
  <strong>Blessed Pauper's Purse</strong> (common), pg 112. This worn cloth purse appears empty, even when opened, yet seems to always have enough copper pieces in it to make any purchase of urgent necessity when you dig inside. The purse produces enough copper pieces to provide for a poor lifestyle. In addition, if anyone asks you for charity, you can always open the purse to find 1 or 2 cp available to give away. These coins appear only if you truly intend to gift them to one who asks.
  <strong>Blinding Lantern</strong> (uncommon), pg 112. This ornate brass lantern comes fitted with heavily inscribed plates shielding the cut crystal lens. With a flick of a lever, as an action, the plates rise and unleash a dazzling array of lights at a single target within 30 feet. You must use two hands to direct the lights precisely into the eyes of a foe. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature blinded by the lantern is immune to its effects for 1 minute afterward. This property can't be used in a brightly lit area. By opening the shutter on the opposite side, the device functions as a normal bullseye lantern, yet illuminates magically, requiring no fuel and giving off no heat.
  <strong>Blood Mark</strong> (uncommon), pg 112. Used as a form of currency between undead lords and the humanoids of their lands, this coin resembles a gold ring with a single hole in the center. It holds 1 charge, visible as a red glow in the center of the coin. While holding the coin, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and regain 1d3 hit points. At the same time, the humanoid who pledged their blood to the coin takes necrotic damage and reduces their hit point maximum by an equal amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. You can expend the charges in up to 5 blood marks as part of the same action. To replenish an expended charge in a blood mark, a humanoid must pledge a pint of their blood in a 10-minute ritual that involves letting a drop of their blood fall through the center of the coin. The drop disappears in the process and the center fills with a red glow. There is no limit to how much blood a humanoid may pledge, but each coin can hold only 1 charge. To pledge more, the humanoid must perform the ritual on another blood mark. Any person foolish enough to pledge more than a single blood coin might find the coins all redeemed at once, since such redemptions often happen at great blood feasts held by vampires and other undead.
  <strong>Blood Pearl</strong> (uncommon), pg 112. This crimson pearl feels slick to the touch and contains a mote of blood imbued with malign purpose. As an action, you can break the pearl, destroying it, and conjure a Blood Elemental (see Creature Codex) for 1 hour. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
  <strong>Blood-Soaked Hide</strong> (very rare), pg 16. A creature that starts its turn in your space must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 3d6 hit points due to blood loss, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the number of hit points the creature lost. Constructs and undead who aren't vampires are immune to this effect. Once used, you can't use this property of the armor again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bloodbow</strong> (rare), pg 15. This longbow is carved of a light, sturdy wood such as hickory or yew, and it is almost always stained a deep maroon hue, lacquered and aged under layers of sundried blood. The bow is sometimes decorated with reptilian teeth, centaur tails, or other battle trophies. The bow is designed to harm the particular type of creature whose blood most recently soaked the weapon. When you make a ranged attack roll with this magic weapon against a creature of that type, you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enraged until the end of your next turn. While enraged, the target suffers a random short-term madness.
  <strong>Blooddrinker Spear</strong> (rare), pg 15. Prized by gnolls, the upper haft of this spear is decorated with tiny animal skulls, feathers, and other adornments. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this spear, you mark that creature for 1 hour. Until the mark ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with the spear, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find the target. If the target drops to 0 hit points, the mark ends. This property can't be used on a different creature until you spend a short rest cleaning the previous target's blood from the spear.
  <strong>Bloodfuel Weapon</strong> (rare), pg 15. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can spend one or more Hit Dice, up to your maximum Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You lose hit points equal to the total, and the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to the total. You can't use this feature of the weapon if you don't have blood. Hit Dice spent using this weapon's feature can't be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.
  <strong>Bloodlink Potion</strong> (common), pg 49. When you and another willing creature each drink at least half this potion, your life energies are linked for 1 hour. When you or the creature who drank the potion with you take damage while your life energies are linked, the total damage is divided equally between you. If the damage is an odd number, roll randomly to assign the extra point of damage. The effect is halted while you and the other creature are separated by more than 60 feet. The effect ends if either of you drop to 0 hit points. This potion's red liquid is viscous and has a metallic taste.
  <strong>Bloodpearl Bracelet</strong> (uncommon (silver), very rare (gold)), pg 113. This silver or gold bracelet features three red pearls. You can use an action to remove a pearl and throw it up to 20 feet. When the pearl lands, it transforms into an ooze you determine by rolling a d6 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bracelet's color. The ooze vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. When you throw a pearl, your hit point maximum is reduced by the amount listed in the Blood Price column. This reduction can't be removed with the greater restoration spell or similar magic and lasts until the ooze vanishes or is reduced to 0 hit points. The ooze is friendly to you and your companions and acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the ooze acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once all three pearls have been used, the bracelet can't be used again until the next dawn when the pearls regrow. | d6 | Ooze | CR | Blood Price | | --- | --------------------------- | --- | ---------------- | | 1 | Dipsa | 1/4 | 5 HP | | 2 | Treacle | 1/4 | 5 HP | | 3 | Gray Ooze | 1/2 | 5 HP | | 4 | Alchemy Apprentice Ooze | 1 | 7 ( 2d6) | | 5 | Suppurating Ooze | 1 | 7 ( 2d6) | | 6 | Gelatinous Cube | 2 | 10 ( 3d6) | | d6 | Ooze | CR | Blood Price | | --- | ----------------------- | --- | ---------------- | | 1 | Philosopher's Ghost | 4 | 17 ( 5d6) | | 2 | Ink Guardian Ooze | 4 | 17 ( 5d6) | | 3 | Black Pudding | 4 | 17 ( 5d6) | | 4 | Corrupting Ooze | 5 | 21 ( 6d6) | | 5 | Blood Ooze | 6 | 24 ( 7d6) | | 6 | Ruby ooze | 6 | 24 ( 7d6) |
  <strong>Bloodprice Armor</strong> (legendary), pg 16. When a melee attack would hit you while you are wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to increase your Armor Class by up to 10 against that attack. If you do so, you lose hit points equal to 5 times the bonus you want to add to your AC. For example, if you want to increase your AC by 2 against that attack, you lose 10 hit points.
  <strong>Bloodthirsty Weapon</strong> (rare), pg 16. This magic weapon bears long, branching channels inscribed into its blade or head, and it gives off a coppery scent. When you damage a creature that has blood with this weapon, it loses an additional 2d6 hit points from blood loss.
  <strong>Bloodwhisper Cauldron</strong> (very rare), pg 113. This ancient, oxidized cauldron sits on three stubby legs and has images of sacrifice and ritual cast into its iron sides. When filled with concoctions that contain blood, the bubbling cauldron seems to whisper secrets of ancient power to those bold enough to listen. While filled with blood, the cauldron has the following properties. Once filled, the cauldron can't be refilled again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bludgeon of Nightmares</strong> (rare), pg 16. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. The weapon appears to be a mace of disruption, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. The first time you use this weapon to kill a creature that has an Intelligence score of 5 or higher, you begin having nightmares and disturbing visions that disrupt your rest. Each time you complete a long rest, you must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC equals 10 + the total number of creatures with Intelligence 5 or higher that you've reduced to 0 hit points with this weapon. On a failure, you gain no benefits from that long rest, and you gain one level of exhaustion.
  <strong>Blue Rose</strong> (rare), pg 113. The petals of this cerulean flower can be prepared into a compote and consumed. A single flower can make 3 doses. When you consume a dose, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 1 each. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You can consume up to three doses as part of casting a spell, and you can choose to affect your spell with one of the following options for each dose you consumed: - If the spell is of the abjuration school, increase the save DC by 2. - If the spell has more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, treat the spell's effects as if you had cast the spell at one slot level higher than the spell slot you used. - The spell is affected by one of the following metamagic options, even if you aren't a sorcerer: heightened, quickened, or subtle. A spell can't be affected by the same option more than once, though you can affect one spell with up to three different options. If you consume one or more doses without casting a spell, you can choose to instead affect a spell you cast before you finish a long rest. In addition, consuming blue rose gives you some protection against spells. When a spellcaster you can see casts a spell, you can use your reaction to cause one of the following: - You have advantage on the saving throw against the spell if it is a spell of the abjuration school. - If the spell is counterspell or dispel magic, the DC increases by 2 to interrupt your spellcasting or to end a magic effect on you. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to the number of doses you consumed. At the end of each long rest, you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, your Hit Dice maximum is reduced by 25 percent. This reduction affects only the number of Hit Dice you can use to regain hit points during a short rest; it doesn't reduce your hit point maximum. This reduction lasts until you recover from the addiction. If you have no remaining Hit Dice to lose, you suffer one level of exhaustion, and your Hit Dice are returned to 75 percent of your maximum Hit Dice. The process then repeats until you die from exhaustion or you recover from the addiction. On a successful save, your exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces your level of exhaustion below 1, you recover from the addiction. A greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the addiction and its effects. Consuming at least one dose of blue rose again halts the effects of the addiction for 2 days, at which point you can consume another dose of blue rose to halt it again or the effects of the addiction continue as normal.
  <strong>Blue Willow Cloak</strong> (uncommon), pg 114. This light cloak of fey silk is waterproof. While wearing this cloak in the rain, you can use your action to pull up the hood and become invisible for up to 1 hour. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell, if you use an action to pull down the hood, or if the rain stops. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bone Whip</strong> (very rare), pg 16. This whip is constructed of humanoid vertebrae with their edges magically sharpened and pointed. The bones are joined together into a coiled line by strands of steel wire. The handle is half a femur wrapped in soft leather of tanned humanoid skin. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. You can use an action to cause fiendish energy to coat the whip. For 1 minute, you gain 5 temporary hit points the first time you hit a creature on each turn. In addition, when you deal damage to a creature with this weapon, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. Once used, this property of the whip can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bonebreaker Mace</strong> (rare), pg 17. You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use it to attack an undead creature. Often given to the grim enforcers of great necropolises, these weapons can reduce the walking dead to splinters with a single strike. When you hit an undead creature with this magic weapon, treat that creature as if it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. If it is already vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, your attack deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage.
  <strong>Book Shroud</strong> (uncommon), pg 116. When not bound to a book, this red leather book cover is embossed with images of eyes on every inch of its surface. When you wrap this cover around a tome, it shifts the book's appearance to a plain red cover with a title of your choosing and blank pages on which you can write. When viewing the wrapped book, other creatures see the plain red version with any contents you've written. A creature succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees the real book and can remove the shroud.
  <strong>Book of Ebon Tides</strong> (very rare), pg 114. This strange, twilight-hued tome was written on pages of pure shadow weave, bound in traditional birch board covers wrapped with shadow goblin hide, and imbued with the memories of forests on the Plane of Shadow. Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM's discretion, spells from Deep Magic for 5th Edition can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to darkness, illusion, or shadows, such as invisibility or major image. | DC | Effect | | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | 8 | Obscuring a path and removing all signs of passage (30 feet per point over 7) | | 10 | Creating a grove of trees (30 feet across per point over 9) | | 11 | Creating or drying up a lake or pond (up to 10 feet across per point over 10) | | 12 | Creating a flowing stream (1 foot wide per point over 11) | | 13 | Overgrowing an existing road with brush or trees (300 feet per point over 12) | | 14 | Shifting a river to a new course (300 feet per point over 13) | | 15 | Moving a forest (300 feet per point over 14) | | 16 | Creating a small hill, riverbank, or cliff (10 feet tall per point over 15) | | 17 | Turning a small forest into grassland or clearing, or vice versa (30 feet across per point over 16) | | 18 | Creating a new river (10 feet wide per point over 17) | | 19 | Turning a large forest into grassland, or vice versa (300 feet across per point over 19) | | 20 | Creating a new mountain (1,000 feet high per point over 19) | | 21 | Drying up an existing river (reducing width by 10 feet per point over 20) | | 22 | Shrinking an existing hill or mountain (reducing 1,000 feet per point over 21) | Written by an elvish princess at the Court of Silver Words, this volume encodes her understanding and mastery of shadow. Whimsical illusions suffuse every page, animating its illuminated capital letters and ornamental figures. The book is a famous work among the sable elves of that plane, and it opens to the touch of any elfmarked or sable elf character.
  <strong>Book of Eibon</strong> (legendary), pg 116. This fragmentary black book is reputed to descend from the realms of Hyperborea. It contains puzzling guidelines for frightful necromantic rituals and maddening interdimensional travel. The book holds the following spells: semblance of dread*, ectoplasm*, animate dead, speak with dead, emanation of Yoth*, green decay*, yellow sign*, eldritch communion*, create undead, gate, harm, astral projection, and Void rift*. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM's discretion, the book can contain other spells similarly related to necromancy, madness, or interdimensional travel. If you are attuned to this book, you can use it as a spellbook and as an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the book, you can use a bonus action to cast a necromancy spell that is written in this tome without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the book can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Bookkeeper Inkpot</strong> (uncommon), pg 116. This glass vessel looks like an ordinary inkpot. A quill fashioned from an ostrich feather accompanies the inkpot. You can use an action to speak the inkpot's command word, targeting a Bookkeeper (see Creature Codex) that you can see within 10 feet of you. An unwilling bookkeeper must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be transferred to the inkpot, making you the bookkeeper's new “creator.” While the bookkeeper is contained within the inkpot, it suffers no harm due to being away from its bound book, but it can't use any of its actions or traits that apply to it being in a bound book. Dipping the quill in the inkpot and writing in a book binds the bookkeeper to the new book. If the inkpot is found as treasure, there is a 50 percent chance it contains a bookkeeper. An identify spell reveals if a bookkeeper is inside the inkpot before using the inkpot's ink.
  <strong>Bookmark of Eldritch Insight</strong> (common), pg 116. This cloth bookmark is inscribed with blurred runes that are hard to decipher. If you use this bookmark while researching ancient evils (such as arch-devils or demon lords) or otherworldly mysteries (such as the Void or the Great Old Ones) during a long rest, the bookmark crumbles to dust and grants you its knowledge. You double your proficiency bonus on Arcana, History, and Religion checks to recall lore about the subject of your research for the next 24 hours. If you don't have proficiency in these skills, you instead gain proficiency in them for the next 24 hours, but you are proficient only when recalling information about the subject of your research.
  <strong>Boots of Pouncing</strong> (rare), pg 116. These soft leather boots have a collar made of Albino Death Weasel fur (see Creature Codex). While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 40 feet, unless your walking speed is higher. Your speed is still reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you can make one melee weapon attack against it as a bonus action.
  <strong>Boots of Quaking</strong> (very rare), pg 117. While wearing these steel-toed boots, the earth itself shakes when you walk, causing harmless, but unsettling, tremors. If you move at least 15 feet in a single turn, all creatures within 10 feet of you at any point during your movement must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage and fall prone. In addition, while wearing these boots, you can cast earthquake, requiring no concentration, by speaking a command word and jumping on a point on the ground. The spell is centered on that point. Once you cast earthquake in this way, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Boots of Solid Footing</strong> (uncommon), pg 117. A thick, rubbery sole covers the bottoms and sides of these stout leather boots. They are useful for maneuvering in cluttered alleyways, slick sewers, and the occasional patch of ice or gravel. While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word. If you do, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement when you walk across it wearing these boots. If you speak the command word again as a bonus action, you end the effect. When the boots' property has been used for a total of 1 minute, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.
  <strong>Boots of the Grandmother</strong> (rare), pg 117. While wearing these boots, you have proficiency in the Stealth skill if you don't already have it, and you double your proficiency bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. As an action, you can drip three drops of fresh blood onto the boots to ease your passage through the world. For 1d6 hours, you and your allies within 30 feet of you ignore difficult terrain. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Boots of the Swift Striker</strong> (rare), pg 117. While you wear these boots, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, when you take the Dash action while wearing these boots, you can make a single weapon attack at the end of your movement. You can't continue moving after making this attack.
  <strong>Bottled Boat</strong> (uncommon), pg 117. This clear glass bottle contains a tiny replica of a wooden rowboat down to the smallest detail, including two stout oars, a miniature coil of hemp rope, a fishing net, and a small cask. You can use an action to break the bottle, destroying the bottle and releasing its contents. The rowboat and all of the items emerge as full-sized, normal, and permanent items of their type, which includes 50 feet of hempen rope, a cask containing 20 gallons of fresh water, two oars, and a 12-foot-long rowboat.
  <strong>Bountiful Cauldron</strong> (common), pg 117. If this small, copper cauldron is filled with water and a half pound of meat, vegetables, or other foodstuffs then placed over a fire, it produces a simple, but hearty stew that provides one creature with enough nourishment to sustain it for one day. As long as the food is kept within the cauldron with the lid on, the food remains fresh and edible for up to 24 hours, though it grows cold unless reheated.
  <strong>Bow of Accuracy</strong> (common), pg 17. The normal range of this bow is doubled, but its long range remains the same.
  <strong>Box of Secrets</strong> (rare), pg 117. This well-made, cubical box appears to be a normal container that can hold as much as a normal chest. However, each side of the chest is a lid that can be opened on cunningly concealed hinges. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the sides can be opened. When you use an action to turn the box so a new side is facing up, and speak the command word before opening the lid, the current contents of the chest slip into an interdimensional space, leaving it empty once more. You can use an action to fill the box again, then turn it over to a new side and open it, again sending the contents to the interdimensional space. This can be done up to six times, once for each side of the box. To gain access to a particular batch of contents, the correct side must be facing up, and you must use an action to speak the command word as you open the lid on that side. A box of secrets is often crafted with specific means of telling the sides apart, such as unique carvings on each side, or having each side painted a different color. If any side of the box is destroyed completely, the contents that were stored through that side are lost. Likewise, if the entire box is destroyed, the contents are lost forever.
  <strong>Bracelet of the Fire Tender</strong> (uncommon), pg 118. This bracelet is made of thirteen small, roasted pinecones lashed together with lengths of dried sinew. It smells of pine and woodsmoke. It is uncomfortable to wear over bare skin. While wearing this bracelet, you don't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when looking in areas lightly obscured by nonmagical smoke or fog.
  <strong>Braid Whip Clasp</strong> (uncommon), pg 118. This intricately carved ivory clasp can be wrapped around or woven into braided hair 3 feet or longer. While the clasp is attached to your braided hair, you can speak its command word as a bonus action and transform your braid into a dangerous whip. If you speak the command word again, you end the effect. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip. When the clasp's property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, you can't use it to transform your braid into a whip again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Brain Juice</strong> (very rare), pg 49. This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures, such as aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains 1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker is afflicted with short-term madness for 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, it is afflicted with long-term madness permanently and automatically fails all further saving throws brought about by drinking brain juice.
  <strong>Brass Clockwork Staff</strong> (rare), pg 72. This curved staff is made of coiled brass and glass wire. You can use an action to speak one of three command words and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff transforms into one of three wireframe creatures, depending on the command word: a unicorn, a hound, or a swarm of tiny beetles. The wireframe creature or swarm is under your control and acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, you can mentally command the wireframe creature or swarm if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the creature takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. The wireframe unicorn lasts for up to 1 hour, uses the statistics of a warhorse, and can be used as a mount. The wireframe hound lasts for up to 5 minutes, uses the statistics of a dire wolf, and has advantage to track any creature you damaged within the past hour. The wireframe beetle swarm lasts for up to 1 minute, uses the statistics of a swarm of beetles, and can destroy nonmagical objects that aren't being worn or carried and that aren't made of stone or metal (destruction happens at a rate of 1 pound of material per round, up to a maximum of 10 pounds). At the end of the duration, the wireframe creature or swarm reverts to its staff form. It reverts to its staff form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. If it reverts to its staff form early by being reduced to 0 hit points, the staff becomes inert and unusable until the third dawn after the creature was killed. Otherwise, the wireframe creature or swarm has all of its hit points when you transform the staff into the creature again. When a wireframe creature or swarm becomes the staff again, this property of the staff can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Brass Snake Ball</strong> (rare), pg 118. Most commonly used by assassins to strangle sleeping victims, this heavy, brass ball is 6 inches across and weighs approximately 15 pounds. It has the image of a coiled snake embossed around it. You can use an action to command the orb to uncoil into a brass snake approximately 6 feet long and 3 inches thick. You can direct it by telepathic command to attack any creature within your line of sight. Use the statistics for the constrictor snake, but use Armor Class 14 and increase the challenge rating to 1/2 (100 XP). The snake can stay animate for up to 5 minutes or until reduced to 0 hit points. Being reduced to 0 hit points causes the snake to revert to orb form and become inert for 1 week. If damaged but not reduced to 0 hit points, the snake has full hit points when summoned again. Once you have used the orb to become a snake, it can't be used again until the next sunset.
  <strong>Brawler's Leather</strong> (common), pg 118. These rawhide straps have lines of crimson runes running along their length. They require 10 minutes of bathing them in salt water before carefully wrapping them around your forearms. Once fitted, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes. The straps become brittle with use. After you have dealt damage with unarmed strike attacks 10 times, the straps crumble away.
  <strong>Brawn Armor</strong> (rare), pg 17. This armor was crafted from the hide of an ancient grizzly bear. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on grapple checks. The armor has 3 charges. You can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to deal your unarmed strike damage to a creature you are grappling. The armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Brazen Band</strong> (uncommon), pg 72. Made by kobold clockwork mages, this brass clockwork ring is formed to look like a coiled dragon. When you speak or whisper the Draconic command word etched on the inside of the ring, the brass dragon uncoils and attempts to pick any lock within 10 feet of you. The dragon picks the lock using your proficiency bonus but with advantage. It is treated as having thieves' tools when attempting to pick locks. It uses your Dexterity (Stealth) bonus for purposes of not being spotted but with advantage due to its extremely small size. Whether successful or not, once you have used the ring to attempt to pick a lock, it can't be used again until the next sunset.
  <strong>Brazen Bulwark</strong> (rare), pg 18. This rectangular shield is plated with polished brass and resembles a crenelated tower. While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.
  <strong>Breaker Lance</strong> (rare), pg 17. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you attack an object or structure with this magic lance and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target. The lance has 3 charges. As part of an attack action with the lance, you can expend a charge while striking a barrier created by a spell, such as a wall of fire or wall of force, or an entryway protected by the arcane lock spell. You must make a Strength check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. The lance regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Breathing Reed</strong> (common), pg 118. This tiny river reed segment is cool to the touch. If you chew the reed while underwater, it provides you with enough air to breathe for up to 10 minutes. At the end of the duration, the reed loses its magic and can be harmlessly swallowed or spit out.
  <strong>Briarthorn Bracers</strong> (uncommon), pg 118. These leather bracers are inscribed with Elvish runes. While wearing these bracers, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are using no shield. In addition, while in a forest, nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.
  <strong>Broken Fang Talisman</strong> (common), pg 118. This talisman is a piece of burnished copper, shaped into a curved fang with a large crack through the middle. While wearing the talisman, you can use an action to cast the encrypt / decrypt (see Deep Magic for 5th Edition) spell. The talisman can't be used this way again until 1 hour has passed.
  <strong>Broom of Sweeping</strong> (common), pg 119. You can use an action to speak the broom's command word and give it short instructions consisting of a few words, such as “sweep the floor” or “dust the cabinets.” The broom can clean up to 5 cubic feet each minute and continues cleaning until you use another action to deactivate it. The broom can't climb barriers higher than 5 feet and can't open doors.
  <strong>Brotherhood of Fezzes</strong> (uncommon), pg 119. This trio of fezzes works only if all three hats are worn within 60 feet of each other by creatures of the same size. If one of the hats is removed or moves further than 60 feet from the others or if creatures of different sizes are wearing the hats, the hats' magic temporarily ceases. While three creatures of the same size wear these fezzes within 60 feet of each other, each creature can use its action to cast the alter self spell from it at will. However, all three wearers of the fezzes are affected as if the same spell was simultaneously cast on each of them, making each wearer appear identical to the other. For example, if one Medium wearer uses an action to change its appearance to that of a specific elf, each other wearer's appearance changes to look like the exact same elf.
  <strong>Bubbling Retort</strong> (uncommon), pg 119. This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper. You can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last for 1d4 + 1 rounds. While they last, creatures within the radius are blinded and the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking sound but no other effect.
  <strong>Buckle of Blasting</strong> (legendary), pg 119. This soot-colored steel buckle has an exploding flame etched into its surface. It can be affixed to any common belt. While wearing this buckle, you have resistance to force damage. In addition, the buckle has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. It has the following properties.
  <strong>Bullseye Arrow</strong> (uncommon), pg 17. This arrow has bright red fletching and a blunt, red tip. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic arrow. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, but it paints a magical red dot on the target for 1 minute. While the dot lasts, the target takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type from any ranged attack that hits it. In addition, ranged weapon attacks against the target score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. When this arrow hits a target, the arrow vanishes in a flash of red light and is destroyed.
  <strong>Burglar's Lock and Key</strong> (uncommon), pg 119. This heavy iron lock bears a stout, pitted key permanently fixed in the keyhole. As an action, you can twist the key counterclockwise to instantly open one door, chest, bag, bottle, or container of your choice within 30 feet. Any container or portal weighing more than 30 pounds or restrained in any way (latched, bolted, tied, or the like) automatically resists this effect.
  <strong>Burning Skull</strong> (very rare), pg 119. This appallingly misshapen skull—though alien and monstrous in aspect—is undeniably human, and it is large and hollow enough to be worn as a helm by any Medium humanoid. The skull helm radiates an unholy spectral aura, which sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. According to legends, gazing upon a burning skull freezes the blood and withers the brain of one who understands not its mystery.
  <strong>Butter of Disbelief</strong> (uncommon), pg 120. This stick of magical butter is carved with arcane runes and never melts or spoils. It has 3 charges. While holding this butter, you can use an action to slice off a piece and expend 1 charge to cast the grease spell (save DC 13) from it. The grease that covers the ground looks like melted butter. The butter regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, the butter disappears.
  <strong>Buzzing Blade</strong> (rare), pg 17. You can use a bonus action to speak this weapon's command word, causing the blade to emit a loud buzzing sound. The buzzing noise is audible out to 100 feet. While the sword is buzzing, it deals an extra 2d6 thunder damage to any target it hits. The buzzing lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the weapon.
  <strong>Candied Axe</strong> (very rare), pg 18. This battleaxe bears a golden head spun from crystalized honey. Its wooden handle is carved with reliefs of bees. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
  <strong>Candle of Communion</strong> (uncommon), pg 120. This black candle burns with an eerie, violet flame. The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. When lit, the candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Each creature in the candle's light has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on necromancy spells. After burning for 1 hour, or if the candle's flame is magically or nonmagically snuffed out, it is destroyed. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the speak with dead spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
  <strong>Candle of Summoning</strong> (uncommon), pg 120. This black candle burns with an eerie, green flame. The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. When lit, the candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Each creature in the candle's light has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on conjuration spells. After burning for 1 hour, or if the flame is magically or nonmagically snuffed out, it is destroyed. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the spirit guardians spell (save DC 15) with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
  <strong>Candle of Visions</strong> (common), pg 120. This black candle burns with an eerie, blue flame. The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. When lit, the candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Each creature in the candle's light has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on divination spells. After burning for 1 hour, or if the flame is magically or nonmagically snuffed out, it is destroyed. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the augury spell with it, which reveals its otherworldly omen in the candle's smoke. Doing so destroys the candle.
  <strong>Cap of Thorns</strong> (very rare), pg 120. Donning this thorny wooden circlet causes it to meld with your scalp. It can be removed only upon your death or by a remove curse spell. The cap ingests some of your blood, dealing 2d4 piercing damage. After this first feeding, the thorns feed once per day for 1d4 piercing damage. Once per day, you can sacrifice 1 hit point per level you possess to cast a special entangle spell made of thorny vines. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this effect. Restrained creatures must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be affected by a charm person spell as thorns pierce their body. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target fails three consecutive saves, the thorns become deeply rooted and the charmed effect is permanent until remove curse or similar magic is cast on the target.
  <strong>Cape of Targeting</strong> (rare), pg 121. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this long, flowing cloak. Whenever you are within 10 feet of more than two creatures, it subtly and slowly shifts its color to whatever the creatures nearest you find the most irritating. While within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you can use a bonus action to speak the cloak's command word to activate it, allowing your allies' ranged attacks to pass right through you. For 1 minute, each friendly creature that makes a ranged attack against a hostile creature within 5 feet of you has advantage on the attack roll. Each round the cloak is active, it enthusiastically and telepathically says “shoot me!” in different tones and cadences into the minds of each friendly creature that can see you and the cloak. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Captain's Flag</strong> (rare), pg 121. This red and white flag adorned with a white anchor is made of velvet that never seems to fray in strong wings. When mounted and flown on a ship, the flag changes to the colors and symbol of the ship's captain and crew. While this flag is mounted on a ship, the captain and its allies have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, when the captain is reduced to 0 hit points while on the ship where this flag flies, each ally of the captain has advantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
  <strong>Captain's Goggles</strong> (rare), pg 121. These copper and glass goggles are prized by air and sea captains across the world. The goggles are designed to repel water and never fog. After attuning to the goggles, your name (or preferred moniker) appears on the side of the goggles. While wearing the goggles, you can't suffer from exhaustion.
  <strong>Case of Preservation</strong> (common), pg 121. This item appears to be a standard map or scroll case fashioned of well-oiled leather. You can store up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment in this container. While ensconced in the case, the contents are protected from damage caused by fire, exposure to water, age, or vermin.
  <strong>Cataloguing Book</strong> (rare), pg 121. This nondescript book contains statistics and details on various objects. Libraries often use these tomes to assist visitors in finding the knowledge contained within their stacks. You can use an action to touch the book to an object you wish to catalogue. The book inscribes the object's name, provided by you, on one of its pages and sketches a rough illustration to accompany the object's name. If the object is a magic item or otherwise magic-imbued, the book also inscribes the object's properties. The book becomes magically connected to the object, and its pages denote the object's current location, provided the object is not protected by nondetection or other magic that thwarts divination magic. When you attune to this book, its previously catalogued contents disappear.
  <strong>Catalyst Oil</strong> (rare), pg 49. This special elemental compound draws on nearby energy sources. Catalyst oils are tailored to one specific damage type (not including bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage) and have one dose. Whenever a spell or effect of this type goes off within 60 feet of a dose of catalyst oil, the oil catalyzes and becomes the spell's new point of origin. If the spell affects a single target, its original point of origin becomes the new target. If the spell's area is directional (such as a cone or a cube) you determine the spell's new direction. This redirected spell is easier to evade. Targets have advantage on saving throws against the spell, and the caster has disadvantage on the spell attack roll.
  <strong>Celestial Charter</strong> (rare), pg 49. Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the celestial, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The celestial is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the celestial, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the celestial refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the celestial reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the charter and have the celestial do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the celestial to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll vanishes in a bright flash of light. A celestial typically attempts to fulfill its end of the bargain as best it can, and it is angry if you exploit any loopholes or literal interpretations to your advantage. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 radiant damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.
  <strong>Celestial Sextant</strong> (uncommon), pg 122. The ancient elves constructed these sextants to use as navigational aids on all their seagoing vessels. The knowledge of their manufacture has been lost, and few of them remain. While attuned to the sextant, you can spend 1 minute using the sextant to determine your latitude and longitude, provided you can see the sun or stars. You can use an action steer up to four vessels that are within 1 mile of the sextant, provided their crews are willing. To do so, you must have spent at least 1 hour aboard each of the controlled vessels, performing basic sailing tasks and familiarizing yourself with the vessel.
  <strong>Censer of Dark Shadows</strong> (uncommon), pg 122. This enchanted censer paints the air with magical, smoky shadow. While holding the censer, you can use an action to speak its command word, causing the censer to emit shadow in a 30-foot radius for 1 hour. Bright light and sunlight within this area is reduced to dim light, and dim light within this area is reduced to magical darkness. The shadow spreads around corners, and nonmagical light can't illuminate this shadow. The shadow emanates from the censer and moves with it. Completely enveloping the censer within another sealed object, such as a lidded pot or a leather bag, blocks the shadow. If any of this effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled. Once the censer is used to emit shadow, it can't do so again until the next dusk.
  <strong>Centaur Wrist-Wraps</strong> (uncommon), pg 122. These leather and fur wraps are imbued with centaur shamanic magic. The wraps are stained a deep amber color, and intricate motifs painted in blue seem to float above the surface of the leather. While wearing these wraps, you can call on their magic to reroll an attack made with a shortbow or longbow. You must use the new roll. Once used, the wraps must be held in wood smoke for 15 minutes before they can be used in this way again.
  <strong>Cephalopod Breastplate</strong> (rare), pg 18. This bronze breastplate depicts two krakens fighting. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can use an action to speak the armor's command word to release a cloud of black mist (if above water) or black ink (if underwater). It billows out from you in a 20-foot-radius cloud of mist or ink. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) or a significant current disperses it. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Chainbreaker Blade</strong> (rare), pg 18. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you use this weapon to attack or break chains, manacles, or similar metal objects restraining creatures, you have advantage on the attack roll or ability check. In addition, such items have vulnerability to this sword's weapon damage.
  <strong>Chalice of Forbidden Ecstasies</strong> (uncommon), pg 122. The cup of this garnet chalice is carved in the likeness of a human skull. When the chalice is filled with blood, the dark red gemstone pulses with a scintillating crimson light that sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. Each creature that drinks blood from this chalice has disadvantage on enchantment spells you cast for the next 24 hours. In addition, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell, using your spell save DC, on a creature that has drunk blood from the chalice within the past 24 hours. You need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration. Once used, the suggestion power of the chalice can't be used again until the next dusk.
  <strong>Chalk of Exodus</strong> (uncommon), pg 122. This piece of chalk glitters in the light, as if infused with particles of mica or gypsum. The chalk has 10 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 charge to draw a door on any solid surface upon which the chalk can leave a mark. You can then push open the door while picturing a real door within 10 miles of your current location. The door you picture must be one that you have passed through, in the normal fashion, once before. The chalk opens a magical portal to that other door, and you can step through the portal to appear at that other location as if you had stepped through that other door. At the destination, the target door opens, revealing a glowing portal from which you emerge. Once through, you can shut the door, dispelling the portal, or you can leave it open for up to 1 minute. While the door is open, any creature that can fit through the chalk door can traverse the portal in either direction. Each time you use the chalk, roll a 1d20. On a roll of 1, the magic malfunctions and connects you to a random door similar to the one you pictured within the same range, though it might be a door you have never seen before. The chalk becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
  <strong>Chamrosh Salve</strong> (rare), pg 123. This 3-inch-diameter ceramic jar contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a syrupy mixture that smells faintly of freshly washed dog fur. The jar is a glorious gold-white, resembling the shimmering fur of a Chamrosh (see Tome of Beasts 2), the holy hound from which this salve gets its name. As an action, one dose of the ointment can be applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 1 hit points and is cured of the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.
  <strong>Charlatan's Veneer</strong> (uncommon), pg 123. This silken scarf is a more powerful version of the Commoner's Veneer (see page 128). When in an area containing 12 or more humanoids, Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot you have disadvantage. You can use a bonus action to call on the power in the scarf to invoke a sense of trust in those to whom you speak. If you do so, you have advantage on the next Charisma (Persuasion) check you make against a humanoid while you are in an area containing 12 or more humanoids. In addition, while wearing the scarf, you can use modify memory on a humanoid you have successfully persuaded in the last 24 hours. The scarf can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Charm of Restoration</strong> (common), pg 123. This fist-sized ball of tightly-wound green fronds contains the bark of a magical plant with curative properties. A natural loop is formed from one of the fronds, allowing the charm to be hung from a pack, belt, or weapon pommel. As long as you carry this charm, whenever you are targeted by a spell or magical effect that restores your hit points, you regain an extra 1 hit point.
  <strong>Chieftain's Axe</strong> (very rare), pg 18. Furs conceal the worn runes lining the haft of this oversized, silver-headed battleaxe. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this silvered, magic weapon.
  <strong>Chillblain Armor</strong> (very rare), pg 18. This armor is forged from overlapping blue steel plates or blue rings and has a frosted appearance. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become numbed by the supernatural cold radiating from the armor. A creature numbed by the cold can use either an action or bonus action on its turn, not both, and its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
  <strong>Chronomancer's Pocket Clock</strong> (very rare), pg 123. This golden pocketwatch has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. While holding it, you can use an action to wind it and expend 1 charge to cast the haste spell from it. If the pendant is destroyed (AC 14, 15 hit points) while it has 3 charges, the creature that broke it gains the effects of the time stop spell.
  <strong>Cinch of the Wolfmother</strong> (uncommon), pg 123. This belt is made of the treated and tanned intestines of a dire wolf, enchanted to imbue those who wear it with the ferocity and determination of the wolf. While wearing this belt, you can use an action to cast the druidcraft or speak with animals spell from it at will. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to the belt and fail two death saving throws, you die immediately as your body violently erupts in a shower of blood, and a dire wolf emerges from your entrails. You assume control of the dire wolf, and it gains additional hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points prior to death. The belt then crumbles and is destroyed. If the wolf is targeted by a remove curse spell, then you are reborn when the wolf dies, just as the wolf was born when you died. However, if the curse remains after the wolf dies, you remain dead.
  <strong>Circlet of Holly</strong> (uncommon), pg 124. While wearing this circlet, you gain the following benefits: - **Language of the Fey**. You can speak and understand Sylvan. - **Friend of the Fey.** You have advantage on ability checks to interact socially with fey creatures. - **Poison Sense.** You know if any food or drink you are holding contains poison.

  <strong>Clacking Teeth</strong> (rare), pg 124. Taken from a Fleshspurned (see Tome of Beasts 2), a toothy ghost, this bony jaw holds oversized teeth that sweat ectoplasm. The jaw has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the jaw, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 30 feet of you. The jaw's teeth clatter together, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be confused for 1 minute. While confused, the target acts as if under the effects of the confusion spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <strong>Clamor Bell</strong> (common), pg 124. You can affix this small, brass bell to an object with the leather cords tied to its top. If anyone other than you picks up, interacts with, or uses the object without first speaking the bell's command word, it rings for 5 minutes or until you touch it and speak the command word again. The ringing is audible 100 feet away. If a creature takes an action to cut the bindings holding the bell onto the object, the bell ceases ringing 1 round after being released from the object.
  <strong>Clarifying Goggles</strong> (uncommon), pg 124. These goggles contain a lens of slightly rippled blue glass that turns clear underwater. While wearing these goggles underwater, you don't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through silt, murk, or other natural underwater phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure your vision. While wearing these goggles above water, your vision is lightly obscured.
  <strong>Cleaning Concoction</strong> (common), pg 50. This fresh-smelling, clear green liquid can cover a Medium or smaller creature or object (or matched set of objects, such as a suit of clothes or pair of boots). Applying the liquid takes 1 minute. It removes soiling, stains, and residue, and it neutralizes and removes odors, unless those odors are particularly pungent, such as in skunks or creatures with the Stench trait. Once the potion has cleaned the target, it evaporates, leaving the creature or object both clean and dry.
  <strong>Cloak of Coagulation</strong> (uncommon), pg 124. While wearing this rust red cloak, your blood quickly clots. When you are subjected to an effect that causes additional damage on subsequent rounds due to bleeding, blood loss, or continual necrotic damage, such as a horned devil's tail attack or a sword of wounding, the effect ceases after a single round of damage. For example, if a stirge hits you with its proboscis, you take the initial damage, plus the damage from blood loss on the following round, after which the wound clots, the stirge detaches, and you take no further damage. The cloak doesn't prevent a creature from using such an attack or effect again; a horned devil or a stirge can attack you again, though the cloak will continue to stop any recurring effects after a single round.
  <strong>Cloak of Petals</strong> (uncommon), pg 124. This delicate cloak is covered in an array of pink, purple, and yellow flowers. While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in areas containing flowering plants. The cloak has 3 charges.

If you do so, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. The cloak regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Cloak of Sails</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. The interior of this simple, black cloak looks like white sailcloth. While wearing this cloak, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. You lose this bonus while using the cloak's Sailcloth property.

It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the legion of rabid squirrels spell (see Deep Magic for 5th Edition) from it. You don't need to be in a forest to cast the spell from this cloak, as the squirrels come from within the cloak. When the spell ends, the swarm vanishes back inside the cloak.
  <strong>Cloak of Wicked Wings</strong> (uncommon), pg 126. From a distance, this long, black cloak appears to be in tatters, but a closer inspection reveals that it is sewn from numerous scraps of cloth and shaped like bat wings. While wearing this cloak, you can use your action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a swarm of bats. While in the form of a swarm of bats, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don't need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. If you are a druid with the Wild Shape feature, this transformation instead lasts as long as your Wild Shape lasts. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Cloak of the Bearfolk</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. While wearing this cloak, your Constitution score is 15, and you have proficiency in the Athletics skill. The cloak has no effect if you already have proficiency in this skill or if your Constitution score is already 15 or higher.
  <strong>Cloak of the Eel</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. While wearing this rough, blue-gray leather cloak, you have a swimming speed of 40 feet. When you are hit with a melee weapon attack while wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to generate a powerful electric charge.

The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Cloak of the Empire</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. This voluminous grey cloak has bright red trim and the sigil from an unknown empire on its back. The cloak is stiff and doesn't fold as easily as normal cloth. Whenever you are struck by a ranged weapon attack, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage from that attack by your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
  <strong>Cloak of the Inconspicuous Rake</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. This cloak is spun from simple gray wool and closed with a plain, triangular copper clasp. While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to make yourself forgettable for 5 minutes. A creature that sees you must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw as soon as you leave its sight. On a failure, the witness remembers seeing a person doing whatever you did, but it doesn't remember details about your appearance or mannerisms and can't accurately describe you to another. Creatures with truesight aren't affected by this cloak. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Cloak of the Ram</strong> (uncommon), pg 125. While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to transform into a mountain ram (use the statistics of a giant goat). This effect works like the polymorph spell, except you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use an action to transform back into your original form. Each time you transform into a ram in a single day, you retain the hit points you had the last time you transformed. If you were reduced to 0 hit points the last time you were a ram, you can't become a ram again until the next dawn.

  <strong>Clockwork Hand</strong> (uncommon), pg 126. A beautiful work of articulate brass, this prosthetic clockwork hand (or hands) can't be worn if you have both of your hands. While wearing this hand, you gain a +2 bonus to damage with melee weapon attacks made with this hand or weapons wielded in this hand.
  <strong>Clockwork Hare</strong> (legendary), pg 126. Gifted by a deity of time and clockwork, these simple-seeming trinkets portend some momentous event. The figurine resembles a hare with a clock in its belly. You can use an action to press the ears down and activate the clock, which spins chaotically. The hare emits a field of magic in a 30- foot radius from it for 1 hour. The field moves with the hare, remaining centered on it. While within the field, you and up to 5 willing creatures of your choice exist outside the normal flow of time, and all other creatures and objects are frozen in time. If an affected creature moves outside the field, the creature immediately becomes frozen in time until it is in the field again. The field ends early if an affected creature attacks, touches, alters, or has any other physical or magical impact on a creature, or an object being worn or carried by a creature, that is frozen in time. When the field ends, the figurine turns into a nonmagical, living white hare that goes bounding off into the distance, never to be seen again.
  <strong>Clockwork Mace of Divinity</strong> (uncommon), pg 19. This clockwork mace is composed of several different metals. While attuned to this magic weapon, you have proficiency with it. As a bonus action, you can command the mace to transform into a trident. When you hit with an attack using this weapon's trident form, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
  <strong>Clockwork Mynah Bird</strong> (rare), pg 126. This mechanical brass bird is nine inches long from the tip of its beak to the end of its tail, and it can become active for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. If you use your action to speak the first command word (“listen” in Ignan), it cocks its head and listens intently to all nearby sounds with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 17 for up to 10 minutes. When you give the second command word (“speak”), it repeats back what it heard in a metallic-sounding—though reasonably accurate—portrayal of the sounds. You can use the clockwork mynah bird to relay sounds and conversations it has heard to others. As an action, you can command the mynah to fly to a location it has previously visited within 1 mile. It waits at the location for up to 1 hour for someone to command it to speak. At the end of the hour or after it speaks its recording, it returns to you. The clockwork mynah bird has an Armor Class of 14, 5 hit points, and a flying speed of 50 feet.
  <strong>Clockwork Pendant</strong> (rare), pg 127. This pendant resembles an ornate, miniature clock and has 3 charges. While holding this pendant, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the blur, haste, or slow spell (save DC 15) from it. The spell's duration changes to 3 rounds, and it doesn't require concentration. You can have only one spell active at a time. If you cast another, the previous spell effect ends. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the pendant is destroyed (AC 14, 15 hit points) while it has 3 charges, it creates a temporal distortion for 1d4 rounds. For the duration, each creature and object that enters or starts its turn within 10 feet of the pendant has immunity to all damage, all spells, and all other physical or magical effects but is otherwise able to move and act normally. If a creature moves further than 10 feet from the pendant, these effects end for it. At the end of the duration, the pendant crumbles to dust.
  <strong>Clockwork Rogue Ring</strong> (uncommon), pg 72. Made by kobold clockwork mages, this brass clockwork ring is formed to look like a coiled dragon. When you speak or whisper the Draconic command word etched on the inside of the ring, the brass dragon uncoils and attempts to pick any lock within 10 feet of you. The dragon picks the lock using your proficiency bonus but with advantage. It is treated as having thieves' tools when attempting to pick locks. It uses your Dexterity (Stealth) bonus for purposes of not being spotted but with advantage due to its extremely small size. Whether successful or not, once you have used the ring to attempt to pick a lock, it can't be used again until the next sunset.
  <strong>Clockwork Spider Cloak</strong> (rare), pg 127. This hooded cloak is made from black spider silk and has thin brass ribbing stitched on the inside. It has 3 charges.

The cloak regains 1d3 charges each day at sunset.
  <strong>Coffer of Memory</strong> (rare), pg 127. This small golden box resembles a jewelry box and is easily mistaken for a common trinket. When attuned to the box, its owner can fill the box with mental images of important events lasting no more than 1 minute each. Any number of memories can be stored this way. These images are similar to a slide show from the bearer's point of view. On a command from its owner, the box projects a mental image of a requested memory so that whoever is holding the box at that moment can see it. If a coffer of memory is found with memories already stored inside it, a newly-attuned owner can view a randomly-selected stored memory with a successful DC 15 Charisma check.
  <strong>Collar of Beast Armor</strong> (uncommon), pg 127. This worked leather collar has stitching in the shapes of various animals. While a beast wears this collar, its base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. It has no effect if the beast's base AC is already 13 or higher.

Some are surrounded in a wreath of hellish (though illusory) flames, while others give off a soft, warm halo of white or golden light. You can use an action to start or stop the light.

When in an area containing 25 or more humanoids, such as a city street, market place, or other public locale, Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot you amid the crowd have disadvantage. This item's power only works for creatures of the humanoid type or those using magic to take on a humanoid form.

When it hits a creature, the mace's mouth stretches gruesomely wide and bites the target, adding 3 (1d6) piercing damage to the attack. As a reaction, you can expend 1 charge to regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt. Alternatively, you can use your reaction to expend 5 charges when you hit a Medium or smaller creature and force the mace to swallow the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed into an extra-dimensional space within the mace. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mace. The target can still breathe. As an action, you can force the mace to regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the mace. The mace automatically regurgitates a trapped creature at dawn when it regains charges.
  <strong>Coral of Enchanted Colors</strong> (legendary), pg 128. This piece of dead, white brain coral glistens with a myriad of colors when placed underwater. While holding this coral underwater, you can use an action to cause a beam of colored light to streak from the coral toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. The beam's color determines its effects, as described below. Each color can be used only once. The coral regains the use of all of its colors at the next dawn if it is immersed in water for at least 1 hour.

Each claw has a reach of 5 feet and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you hit a creature of your size or smaller using a claw, you automatically grapple the creature with the claw. You can have no more than two creatures grappled in this way at a time.

Pulling the gloves on or off requires an action.
  <strong>Craven's Heart</strong> (uncommon), pg 129. This leathery mass of dried meat was once a humanoid heart, taken from an individual that died while experiencing great terror. You can use an action to whisper a command word and hurl the heart to the ground, where it revitalizes and begins to beat rapidly and loudly for 1 minute. Each creature withing 30 feet of the heart has disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. At the end of the duration, the heart bursts from the strain and is destroyed. The heart can be attacked and destroyed (AC 11; hp 3; resistance to bludgeoning damage). If the heart is destroyed before the end if its duration, each creature within 30 feet of the heart must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. This bugbear necromancer was once the henchman of an accomplished practitioner of the dark arts named Varrus. She started as a bodyguard and tough, but her keen intellect caught her master's attention. He eventually took her on as an apprentice. Moxug is fascinated with fear, and some say she doesn't eat but instead sustains herself on the terror of her victims. She eventually betrayed Varrus, sabotaging his attempt to become a lich, and luxuriated in his fear as he realized he would die rather than achieve immortality. According to rumor, the first craven's heart she crafted came from the body of her former master.
  <strong>Crawling Cloak</strong> (varies), pg 129. This unusual cloak is made of many overlapping, broad strips of thick cloth. Crawling Cloak (Common).

This more powerful version of the crawling cloak also allows you to use the prehensile strips of the cloak to climb, giving you a climbing speed of 20 feet.

  <strong>Crimson Starfall Arrow</strong> (uncommon), pg 20. This arrow is a magic weapon powered by the sacrifice of your own life energy and explodes upon impact.

You lose hit points equal to the total, and each creature within 10 feet of the target, including the target, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking necrotic damage equal to the hit points you lost on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can't use this feature of the arrow if you don't have blood. Hit Dice spent on this arrow's feature can't be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.

At the start of each of its turns, a creature with a barb in its flesh must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn as it is wracked with pain.

  <strong>Dancing Ink</strong> (common), pg 130. This ink is favored by merchants for eye-catching banners and by toy makers for scrolls and books for children. Typically found in 1d4 pots, this ink allows you to draw an illustration that moves about the page where it was drawn, whether that is an illustration of waves crashing against a shore along the bottom of the page or a rabbit leaping over the page's text. The ink wears away over time due to the movement and fades from the page after 2d4 weeks. The ink moves only when exposed to light, and some long-forgotten tomes have been opened to reveal small, moving illustrations drawn by ancient scholars. One pot can be used to fill 25 pages of a book or a similar total area for larger banners.
  <strong>Dastardly Quill and Parchment</strong> (rare), pg 130. Favored by spies, this quill and parchment are magically linked as long as both remain on the same plane of existence. When a creature writes or draws on any surface with the quill, that writing or drawing appears on its linked parchment, exactly as it would appear if the writer was writing or drawing on the parchment with black ink. This effect doesn't prevent the quill from being used as a standard quill on a nonmagical piece of parchment, but this written communication is one-way, from quill to parchment. The quill's linked parchment is immune to all nonmagical inks and stains, and any magical messages written on the parchment disappear after 1 minute and aren't conveyed to the creature holding the quill. The parchment is approximately 9 inches wide by 13 inches long. If the quill's writing exceeds the area of the parchment, the older writing fades from the top of the sheet, replaced by the newer writing.

  <strong>Dawn Shard</strong> (uncommon), pg 21. The blade of this magic weapon gleams with a faint golden shine, and the pommel is etched with a sunburst. As a bonus action, you can command the weapon to shed dim light out to 5 feet, to shed bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or to douse the light.

On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained under the log. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone or restrained. A restrained creature can take its action to free itself by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The log lasts for 1 minute then crumbles to dust, freeing those restrained by it.
  <strong>Death's Mirror</strong> (uncommon), pg 73. Made from woven lead and silver, this ring fits only on the hand's smallest finger. As the moon is a dull reflection of the sun's glory, so too is the power within this ring merely an imitation of the healing energies that can bestow true life. The ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
  <strong>Decoy Card</strong> (uncommon), pg 131. This small, thick, parchment card displays an accurate portrait of the person carrying it. You can use an action to toss the card on the ground at a point within 10 feet of you. An illusion of you forms over the card and remains until dispelled. The illusion appears real, but it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusion and can see it, you can use an action to make it move and behave as you wish, as long as it moves no further than 10 feet from the card. Any physical interaction with your illusory double reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect your illusory double identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until the card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the card's face becomes blank, and the card becomes nonmagical.
  <strong>Deepchill Orb</strong> (common), pg 131. This fist-sized sphere of blue quartz emits cold. If placed in a container with a capacity of up to 5 cubic feet, it keeps the internal temperature of the container at a consistent 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This can keep liquids chilled, preserve cooked foods for up to 1 week, raw meats for up to 3 days, and fruits and vegetables for weeks. If you hold the orb without gloves or other insulating method, you take 1 cold damage each minute you hold it. At the GM's discretion, the orb's cold can be applied to other uses, such as keeping it in contact with a hot item to cool down the item enough to be handled, wrapping it and using it as a cooling pad to bring down fever or swelling, or similar.

While holding the wand, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the darkvision spell on yourself. Magical darkness doesn't impede this darkvision.
  <strong>Devilish Doubloon</strong> (very rare), pg 131. This gold coin bears the face of a leering devil on the obverse. If it is placed among other coins, it changes its appearance to mimic its neighbors, doing so over the course of 1 hour. This is a purely cosmetic change, and it returns to its original appearance when grasped by a creature with an Intelligence of 5 or higher. You can use a bonus action to toss the coin up to 20 feet. When the coin lands, it transforms into a barbed devil. The devil vanishes after 1 hour or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the devil vanishes, the coin reappears in a collection of at least 20 gold coins elsewhere on the same plane where it vanished. The devil is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the devil, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and the devil is still alive, it moves to your body and uses its action to grab your soul. You must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the devil steals your soul and you die. If the devil fails to grab your soul, it vanishes as if slain. If the devil grabs your soul, it uses its next action to transport itself back to the Hells, disappearing in a flash of brimstone. If the devil returns to the Hells with your soul, its coin doesn't reappear, and you can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.

You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls with this magic weapon. In addition to the normal effects of a net, this net prevents any Large or smaller aberration, celestial, or fiend hit by it from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. When such a creature is bound in this way, a creature must succeed on a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to free the bound creature. The net has immunity to damage dealt by the bound creature, but another creature can deal 20 slashing damage to the net and free the bound creature, ending the effect. The net has AC 15 and 30 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

A creature affected by this grief must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated by sadness until the end of its next turn. Once a month under an open sky, you can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word and cause the sword to sing a sad dirge.

If an affected creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. At the end of the duration, the coin crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
  <strong>Djinn Vessel</strong> (rare), pg 132. A rough predecessor to the ring of djinni summoning and the ring elemental command, this clay vessel is approximately a foot long and half as wide. An iron stopper engraved with a rune of binding seals its entrance. If the vessel is empty, you can use an action to remove the stopper and cast the banishment spell (save DC 15) on a celestial, elemental, or fiend within 60 feet of you. At the end of the spell's duration, if the target is an elemental, it is trapped in this vessel. While trapped, the elemental can take no actions, but it is aware of occurrences outside of the vessel and of other djinn vessels. You can use an action to remove the vessel's stopper and release the elemental the vessel contains. Once released, the elemental acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
  <strong>Doppelganger Ointment</strong> (rare), pg 132. This ceramic jar contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick, creamy substance that smells faintly of pork fat. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 a pound. Applying a single dose to your body takes 1 minute.

For the duration, you can use a bonus action to return to your normal form, and you can use an action to return to the form of the mimicked creature.

While imitating that creature, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to convince others you are that specific creature, provided they didn't see you change form.
  <strong>Dragonstooth Blade</strong> (very rare), pg 22. This razor-sharp blade, little more than leather straps around the base of a large tooth, still carries the power of a dragon. This weapon's properties are determined by the type of dragon that once owned this tooth. The GM chooses the dragon type or determines it randomly from the options below. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of a type determined by the kind of dragon that once owned the tooth.

  <strong>Dust of Desiccation</strong> (rare), pg 132. This small packet contains soot-like dust. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to blow the choking dust from your palm, each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw can't speak until the end of its next turn as it chokes on the dust. Alternatively, you can use an action to throw the dust into the air, affecting yourself and each creature within 30 feet of you with the dust.

While asleep, the target appears dead to all mundane and magical means, but spells that target the dead, such as the speak with dead spell, fail when used on the target. The cause of death is not evident, though any wounds the target has taken remain visible. If the target takes damage while asleep, it has resistance to the damage. If the target is reduced to below half its hit points while asleep, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to wake up. If the target is reduced to 5 hit points or fewer while asleep, it wakes up. If the target is unwilling, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect of the dust.

The earrings can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Ebon Shards</strong> (very rare), pg 134. These obsidian shards are engraved with words in Deep Speech, and their presence disquiets non-evil, intelligent creatures. The writing on the shards is obscure, esoteric, and possibly incomplete. The shards have 10 charges and give you access to a powerful array of Void magic spells. While holding the shards, you use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from them, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: living shadows* (5 charges), maddening whispers* (2 charges), or void strike* (3 charges).

A bottle of this potion contains 6 doses, and its lid comes with a built-in dropper. You can use an action to apply 1 dose to the eyes of a blinded creature. The blinded condition is suppressed for 2d4 rounds. If the blinded condition has a duration, subtract those rounds from the total duration; if doing so reduces the overall duration to 0 rounds or less, then the condition is removed rather than suppressed.

If the attack hits, the spell also releases tendrils that bind the target, grappling it for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, the grappled target takes 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by the spell. At the end of each of its turns, the grappled target can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, freeing itself from the tendrils on a success.

An identify spell reveals its true nature. If you drink it, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be corrupted by the diabolical power within the elixir for 1 week. While corrupted, you lose immunity to diseases, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.

  <strong>Eye of Horus</strong> (uncommon), pg 134. This gold and lapis lazuli amulet helps you determine reality from phantasms and trickery. While wearing it, you have advantage on saving throws against illusion spells and against being frightened.
  <strong>Eye of the Golden God</strong> (legendary), pg 134. A shining multifaceted violet gem sits at the center of this fist-sized amulet. A beautifully forged band of platinum encircles the gem and affixes it to a well-made series of interlocking platinum chain links. The violet gem is warm to the touch. While wearing this amulet, you can't be frightened and you don't suffer from exhaustion. In addition, you always know which item within 20 feet of you is the most valuable, though you don't know its actual value or if it is magical. Each time you finish a long rest while attuned to this amulet, roll a 1d10. On a 1-3, you awaken from your rest with that many valuable objects in your hand. The objects are minor, such as copper coins, at first and progressively get more valuable, such as gold coins, ivory statuettes, or gemstones, each time they appear. Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.
  <strong>Eyes of the Outer Dark</strong> (very rare), pg 135. These lenses are crafted of polished, opaque black stone.

While you wear these crystal lenses over your eyes, you can sense the presence of any dimensional portal within 60 feet of you and whether the portal is one-way or two-way. Once you have worn the eyes for 10 minutes, their magic ceases to function until the next dawn. Putting the lenses on or off requires an action.
  <strong>Fanged Mask</strong> (uncommon), pg 135. This tribal mask is made of wood and adorned with animal fangs. Once donned, it melds to your face and causes fangs to sprout from your mouth. While wearing this mask, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you already have a bite attack when you don and attune to this mask, your bite attack's damage dice double (for example, 1d4 becomes 2d4).
  <strong>Farhealing Bandages</strong> (uncommon), pg 135. This linen bandage is yellowed and worn with age. You can use an action wrap it around the appendage of a willing creature and activate its magic for 1 hour. While the target is within 60 feet of you and the bandage's magic is active, you can use an action to trigger the bandage, and the target regains 2d4 hit points. The bandage becomes inactive after it has restored 15 hit points to a creature or when 1 hour has passed. Once the bandage becomes inactive, it can't be used again until the next dawn. You can be attuned to only one farhealing bandage at a time.
  <strong>Fear-Eater's Mask</strong> (uncommon), pg 136. This painted, wooden mask bears the visage of a snarling, fiendish face. While wearing the mask, you can use a bonus action to feed on the fear of a frightened creature within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage. You regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. If you are not injured, you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt instead. Once a creature has failed this saving throw, it is immune to the effects of this mask for 24 hours.
  <strong>Feather Token</strong> (varies), pg 136. The following are additional feather token options. Cloud (Uncommon). This white feather is shaped like a cloud. You can use an action to step on the token, which expands into a 10-foot-diameter cloud that immediately begins to rise slowly to a height of up to 20 feet. Any creatures standing on the cloud rise with it. The cloud disappears after 10 minutes, and anything that was on the cloud falls slowly to the ground.  Dark of the Moon (Rare). This black feather is shaped like a crescent moon. As an action, you can brush the feather over a willing creature’s eyes to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For 1 hour, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, including in magical darkness. Afterwards, the feather disappears.   Held Heart (Very Rare). This red feather is shaped like a heart. While carrying this token, you have advantage on initiative rolls. As an action, you can press the feather against a willing, injured creature. The target regains all its missing hit points and the feather disappears.  Jackdaw’s Dart (Common). This black feather is shaped like a dart. While holding it, you can use an action to throw it at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. As it flies, the feather transforms into a blot of black ink. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or the feather leaves a black mark of misfortune on it. The target has disadvantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw then the mark disappears. A remove curse spell ends the mark early.
  <strong>Fellforged Armor</strong> (very rare), pg 23. While wearing this steam-powered magic armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, your Strength score increases by 2, and you gain the ability to cast speak with dead as an action. As long as you remain cursed, you exude an unnatural aura, causing beasts with Intelligence 3 or less within 30 feet of you to be frightened. Once you have used the armor to cast speak with dead, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Ferryman's Coins</strong> (common), pg 136. It is customary in many faiths to weight a corpse's eyes with pennies so they have a fee to pay the ferryman when he comes to row them across death's river to the afterlife. Ferryman's coins, though, ensure the body stays in the ground regardless of the spirit's destination. These coins, which feature a death's head on one side and a lock and chain on the other, prevent a corpse from being raised as any kind of undead. When you place two coins on a corpse's closed lids and activate them with a simple prayer, they can't be removed unless the person is resurrected (in which case they simply fall away), or someone makes a DC 15 Strength check to remove them. Yanking the coins away does no damage to the corpse.
  <strong>Feysworn Contract</strong> (rare), pg 52. This long scroll is written in flowing Elvish, the words flickering with a pale witchlight, and marked with the seal of a powerful fey or a fey lord or lady. When you use an action to present this scroll to a fey whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the fey, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The fey is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the fey, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the fey refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the fey reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the fey do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the fey to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll fades into nothingness. Fey are notoriously clever folk, and while they must adhere to the letter of any bargains they make, they always look for any advantage in their favor. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 poison damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.
  <strong>Fiendish Charter</strong> (rare), pg 52. This long scroll bears the mark of a powerful creature of the Lower Planes, whether an archduke of Hell, a demon lord of the Abyss, or some other powerful fiend or evil deity. When you use an action to present this scroll to a fiend whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the fiend, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The fiend is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the fiend, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the fiend refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the fiend reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the charter in blood and have the fiend do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the fiend to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll ignites and burns into ash. The contract's wording should be carefully considered, as fiends are notorious for finding loopholes or adhering to the letter of the agreement to their advantage. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 necrotic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.
  <strong>Figurehead of Prowess</strong> (varies), pg 136. A figurehead of prowess must be mounted on the bow of a ship for its magic to take effect. While mounted on a ship, the figurehead’s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead’s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the “pilot,” and must use an action to speak the figurehead’s command word.  Albatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator’s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship’s pilot doesn’t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot’s vision.  Basilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s AC increases by 2.  Dragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship’s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn’t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5.  Kraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship’s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship’s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.  Manta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it.  Narwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check.  Octopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.  Sphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn’t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.  Xorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn’t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour burrowing, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.
  <strong>Figurine of Wondrous Power</strong> (varies), pg 137. The following are additional figurine of wondrous power options.  Amber Bee (Uncommon). This amber statuette is of a honeybee. It can become a giant honey bee (see Tome of Beasts 2) for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.  Basalt Cockatrice (Uncommon). This basalt statuette is carved in the likeness of a cockatrice. It can become a cockatrice for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. While it is in cockatrice form, you and your allies within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against being petrified.  Coral Shark (Rare). This coral statuette of a shark can become a hunter shark for up to 6 hours. It can be ridden as a mount, and the rider can breathe underwater while riding it. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.  Hematite Aurochs (Rare). This hematite statuette can become a bull (see Tome of Beasts 2). It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. While in bull form, it is considered to be a Huge creature for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and nonmagical difficult terrain doesn’t cost it extra movement.  Lapis Camel (Rare). This lapis camel can become a camel. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in camel form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. While in camel form, the lapis camel has a blue tint to its fur, and it can spit globs of acid at a creature that attacks it or its rider. This spit works like the acid splash spell (save DC 9).  Marble Mistwolf (Rare). This white marble statuette is of a wolf. It can become a dire wolf for up to 6 hours. At your command, it can cast the fog cloud spell. Each time it does, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. Once its duration ends, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.  Tin Dog (Common). This simple, tin statuette can become a dog for up to 8 hours, loyally following your commands to the best of its abilities. The dog uses the statistics of a jackal, except the dog has a Strength of 10. Once it has been used, the figurine can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.  Violet Octopoid (Rare). A disturbing statuette carved in purple sugilite, the tentacled, violet octopoid can become an ambulatory, amphibious giant octopus for up to 6 hours. Use the statistics of a giant octopus, except it has 100 hit points and can make two tentacle attacks each turn. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 3 days have passed. If you speak the command word in Void Speech, the octopus has an Intelligence score of 9 and can make three tentacle attacks each turn.
  <strong>Firebird Feather</strong> (uncommon), pg 138. This feather sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. While holding the feather, you can tolerate temperatures as low as –50 degrees Fahrenheit. Druids and clerics and paladins who worship nature deities can use the feather as a spellcasting focus. If you use the feather in place of a holy symbol when using your Turn Undead feature, undead in the area have a –1 penalty on the saving throw.
  <strong>Flag of the Cursed Fleet</strong> (legendary), pg 138. This dreaded item is a black flag painted with an unsettlingly realistic skull. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of necromancy around the flag. Beasts with an Intelligence of 3 or lower don’t willingly board a vessel where this flag flies. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check convinces an unwilling beast to board the vessel, though it remains uneasy and skittish while aboard.  Cursed Crew. When this baleful flag flies atop the mast of a waterborne vehicle, it curses the vessel and all those that board it. When a creature that isn’t a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a zombie under the ship captain’s control. When a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a ghoul under the ship captain’s control. A ghoul retains any knowledge of sailing or maintaining a waterborne vehicle that it had in life.  Cursed Captain. If the ship flying this flag doesn’t have a captain, the undead crew seeks out a powerful humanoid or intelligent undead to bring aboard and coerce into becoming the captain. When an undead with an Intelligence of 10 or higher boards the captainless vehicle, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become magically bound to the ship and the flag. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw. The flag fills the captain with the desire to attack other vessels to grow its crew and commandeer larger vessels when possible, bringing the flag with it. If the flag is destroyed or removed from a waterborne vehicle for at least 7 days, the zombie and ghoul crew crumbles to dust, and the captain is freed of the flag’s magic, if the captain was bound to it.  Unholy Vessel. While aboard a vessel flying this flag, an undead creature has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, and if it fails the saving throw, it isn’t destroyed, no matter its CR. In addition, the captain and crew can’t be frightened while aboard a vessel flying this flag.  When a creature that isn’t a construct or undead and isn’t part of the crew boards the vessel, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned while it remains on board. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw.
  <strong>Flash Bullet</strong> (common), pg 23. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this shiny, polished stone, it releases a sudden flash of bright light. The target takes damage as normal and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait have disadvantage on this saving throw.
  <strong>Flask of Epiphanies</strong> (legendary), pg 139. This flask is made of silver and cherry wood, and it holds finely cut garnets on its faces. This ornate flask contains 5 ounces of powerful alcoholic spirits. As an action, you can drink up to 5 ounces of the flask's contents. You can drink 1 ounce without risk of intoxication. When you drink more than 1 ounce of the spirits as part of the same action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw (this DC increases by 1 for each ounce you imbibe after the second, to a maximum of DC 15). On a failed save, you are incapacitated for 1d4 hours and gain no benefits from consuming the alcohol. On a success, your Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) increases by 1 for each ounce you consumed. Whether you fail or succeed, your Dexterity is reduced by 1 for each ounce you consumed. The effect lasts for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) and Inteligence (Religion) checks. The flask replenishes 1d3 ounces of spirits daily at dawn.
  <strong>Fleshspurned Mask</strong> (rare), pg 139. This mask features inhumanly sized teeth similar in appearance to the toothy ghost known as a Fleshspurned (see Tome of Beasts 2). It has a strap fashioned from entwined strands of sinew, and it fits easily over your face with no need to manually adjust the strap. While wearing this mask, you can use its teeth to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the teeth deal necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, if the target has the Incorporeal Movement trait, you deal necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier instead. Such targets don't have resistance or immunity to the necrotic damage you deal with this attack. If you kill a creature with your teeth, you gain temporary hit points equal to double the creature's challenge rating (minimum of 1).
  <strong>Flood Charm</strong> (common), pg 139. This smooth, blue-gray stone is carved with stylized waves or rows of wavy lines. When you are in water too deep to stand, the charm activates. You automatically become buoyant enough to float to the surface unless you are grappled or restrained. If you are unable to surface—such as if you are grappled or restrained, or if the water completely fills the area—the charm surrounds you with a bubble of breathable air that lasts for 5 minutes. At the end of the air bubble's duration, or when you leave the water, the charm's effects end and it becomes a nonmagical stone.
  <strong>Flute of Saurian Summoning</strong> (uncommon), pg 139. This scaly, clawed flute has a musky smell, and it releases a predatory, screeching roar with reptilian overtones when blown. You must be proficient with wind instruments to use this flute. You can use an action to play the flute and conjure dinosaurs. This works like the conjure animals spell, except the animals you conjure must be dinosaurs or Medium or larger lizards. The dinosaurs remain for 1 hour, until they die, or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. The flute can't be used to conjure dinosaurs again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Fly Whisk of Authority</strong> (uncommon), pg 140. If you use an action to flick this fly whisk, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks for 10 minutes. You can't use the fly whisk this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Fog Stone</strong> (uncommon), pg 23. This sling stone is carved to look like a fluffy cloud. Typically, 1d4 + 1 fog stones are found together. When you fire the stone from a sling, it transforms into a miniature cloud as it flies through the air, and it creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on the target or point of impact. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 10 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
  <strong>Forgefire Hammer</strong> (rare), pg 23. The head of this weapon is shaped like an anvil, and engravings of fire and arcane runes decorate it. You can use a bonus action to speak this magic weapon's command word, causing its head to glow red-hot. While red-hot, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The weapon's anvil-like head remains red-hot until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a target holding or wearing a metal object, such as a metal weapon or metal armor, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage and the metal object becomes red-hot for 1 minute. While the object is red-hot and the creature still wears or carries it, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
  <strong>Fountmail</strong> (legendary), pg 23. This armor is a dazzling white suit of chain mail with an alabaster-colored steel collar that covers part of the face. You gain a +3 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. In addition, you gain the following benefits: - You add your Strength and Wisdom modifiers in addition to your Constitution modifier on all rolls when spending Hit Die to recover hit points. - You can't be frightened. - You have resistance to necrotic damage.
  <strong>Freerunner Rod</strong> (very rare), pg 74. Tightly intertwined lengths of grass, bound by additional stiff, knotted blades of grass, form this rod, which is favored by plains-dwelling druids and rangers. While holding it and in grasslands, you leave behind no tracks or other traces of your passing, and you can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, beasts with an Intelligence of 3 or lower that are native to grasslands must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to attack you. The rod has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod collapses into a pile of grass seeds and is destroyed. Among the grass seeds are 1d10 berries, consumable as if created by the goodberry spell.
  <strong>Frost Pellet</strong> (rare), pg 140. Fashioned from the stomach lining of a Devil Shark (see Creature Codex), this rubbery pellet is cold to the touch. When you consume the pellet, you feel bloated, and you are immune to cold damage for 1 hour. Once before the duration ends, you can expel a 30-foot cone of cold water. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d8 cold damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed away.
  <strong>Frostfire Lantern</strong> (very rare), pg 140. While lit, the flame in this ornate mithril lantern turns blue and sheds a cold, blue dim light in a 30-foot radius. After the lantern's flame has burned for 1 hour, it can't be lit again until the next dawn. You can extinguish the lantern's flame early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the lantern's total burn time. When a creature enters the lantern's light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be vulnerable to cold damage until the start of its next turn. When you light the lantern, choose up to four creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, which can include yourself. The chosen creatures are immune to this effect of the lantern's light.
  <strong>Frungilator</strong> (uncommon), pg 74. This strangely-shaped item resembles a melted wand or a strange growth chipped from the arcane trees of elder planes. The wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and point it at a target within 60 feet of you. The target must be a creature. When activated, the wand frunges creatures into a chaos matrix, which does…something. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine these unpredictable effects (none of them especially good). Most effects can be removed by dispel magic, greater restoration, or more powerful magic. | d10 | Frungilator Effect | | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | 1 | Glittering sparkles fly all around. You are surrounded in sparkling light until the end of your next turn as if you were targeted by the faerie fire spell. | | 2 | The target is encased in void crystal and immediately begins suffocating. A creature, including the target, can take its action to shatter the void crystal by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Alternatively, the void crystal can be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 4; immunity to poison and psychic damage). | | 3 | Crimson void fire engulfs the target. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | 4 | The target's blood turns to ice. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | 5 | The target rises vertically to a height of your choice, up to a maximum height of 60 feet. The target remains suspended there until the start of its next turn. When this effect ends, the target floats gently to the ground. | | 6 | The target begins speaking in backwards fey speech for 10 minutes. While speaking this way, the target can't verbally communicate with creatures that aren't fey, and the target can't cast spells with verbal components. | | 7 | Golden flowers bloom across the target's body. It is blinded until the end of its next turn. | | 8 | The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it and all its equipment assumes a gaseous form until the end of its next turn. This effect otherwise works like the gaseous form spell. | | 9 | The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enthralled with its own feet or limbs until the end of its next turn. While enthralled, the target is incapacitated. | | 10 | A giant ray of force springs out of the frungilator and toward the target. Each creature in a line that is 5 feet wide between you and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
  <strong>Fulminar Bracers</strong> (very rare), pg 140. Stylized etchings of cat-like lightning elementals known as Fulminars (see Creature Codex) cover the outer surfaces of these solid silver bracers. While wearing these bracers, lightning crackles harmless down your hands, and you have resistance to lightning damage and thunder damage. The bracers have 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to create lightning shackles that bind up to two creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 4d6 lightning damage and is restrained for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The bracers regain all expended charges daily at dawn. The bracers also regain 1 charge each time you take 10 lightning damage while wearing them.
  <strong>Gale Javelin</strong> (uncommon), pg 24. The metallic head of this javelin is embellished with three small wings. When you speak a command word while making a ranged weapon attack with this magic weapon, a swirling vortex of wind follows its path through the air. Draw a line between you and the target of your attack; each creature within 10 feet of this line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed backward 10 feet and falls prone. In addition, if this ranged weapon attack hits, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed backward 15 feet and falls prone. The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic weapon.
  <strong>Garments of Winter's Knight</strong> (legendary), pg 140. This white-and-blue outfit is designed in the style of fey nobility and maximized for both movement and protection. The multiple layers and snow-themed details of this garb leave no doubt that whoever wears these clothes is associated with the winter queen of faerie. You gain the following benefits while wearing the outfit: - If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier. - Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the cloth steals heat from the surrounding air, and the attacker takes 2d8 cold damage. - You can't be charmed, and you are immune to cold damage. - You can use a bonus action to extend your senses outward to detect the presence of fey. Until the start of your next turn, you know the location of any fey within 60 feet of you.
  <strong>Gauntlet of the Iron Sphere</strong> (very rare), pg 141. This heavy gauntlet is adorned with an onyx. While wearing this gauntlet, your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage, instead of the damage normal for an unarmed strike, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal double damage to objects and structures. If you hold a pound of raw iron ore in your hand while wearing the gauntlet, you can use an action to speak the gauntlet's command word and conjure an Iron Sphere (see Creature Codex). The iron sphere remains for 1 hour or until it dies. It is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the iron sphere, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the iron sphere, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The gauntlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Gazebo of Shade and Shelter</strong> (rare), pg 141. You can use an action to place this 3-inch sandstone gazebo statuette on the ground and speak its command word. Over the next 5 minutes, the sandstone gazebo grows into a full-sized gazebo that remains for 8 hours or until you speak the command word that returns it to a sandstone statuette. The gazebo's posts are made of palm tree trunks, and its roof is made of palm tree fronds. The floor is level, clean, dry and made of palm fronds. The atmosphere inside the gazebo is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The gazebo's walls are opaque from the outside, appearing wooden, but they are transparent from the inside, appearing much like sheer fabric. When activated, the gazebo has an opening on the side facing you. The opening is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall and opens and closes at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the opening. Once closed, the opening is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening. The gazebo is 20 feet in diameter and is 10 feet tall. It is made of sandstone, despite its wooden appearance, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. It has 100 hit points, immunity to nonmagical attacks excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. The gazebo contains crude furnishings: eight simple bunks and a long, low table surrounded by eight mats. Three of the wall posts bear fruit: one coconut, one date, and one fig. A small pool of clean, cool water rests at the base of a fourth wall post. The trees and the pool of water provide enough food and water for up to 10 people. Furnishings and other objects within the gazebo dissipate into smoke if removed from the gazebo. When the gazebo returns to its statuette form, any creatures inside it are expelled into unoccupied spaces nearest to the gazebo's entrance. Once used, the gazebo can't be used again until the next dusk. If reduced to 0 hit points, the gazebo can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
  <strong>Ghost Barding</strong> (uncommon), pg 24. This armor is blue-green and translucent. It weighs only 1 pound, and if the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, this version of the armor doesn't. The armor's base Armor Class applies only against attacks by undead creatures and doesn't provide protection against any other attacks. When a beast wears this armor, the beast gains a +1 bonus to AC against attacks by undead creatures, and it has advantage on saving throws against the spells and special abilities of undead creatures.
  <strong>Ghost Dragon Horn</strong> (very rare), pg 141. Scales from dead dragons cover this wooden, curved horn. You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a blast in a 30-foot cone, containing shrieking spectral dragon heads. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature tales 5d10 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. Dragons have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d10 psychic damage instead of 5d10. A frightened target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a dragon takes damage from the horn's shriek, the horn has a 20 percent chance of exploding. The explosion deals 10d10 psychic damage to the blower and destroys the horn. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until the next dawn. If you kill a dragon while holding or carrying the horn, you regain use of the horn.
  <strong>Ghost Thread</strong> (rare), pg 142. Most of this miles-long strand of enchanted silk, created by phase spiders, resides on the Ethereal Plane. Only a few inches at either end exist permanently on the Material Plane, and those may be used as any normal string would be. Creatures using it to navigate can follow one end to the other by running their hand along the thread, which phases into the Material Plane beneath their grasp. If dropped or severed (AC 8, 1 hit point), the thread disappears back into the Ethereal Plane in 2d6 rounds.
  <strong>Ghoul Light</strong> (very rare), pg 142. This bullseye lantern sheds light as normal when a lit candle is placed inside of it. If the light shines on meat, no matter how toxic or rotten, for at least 10 minutes, the meat is rendered safe to eat. The lantern's magic doesn't improve the meat's flavor, but the light does restore the meat's nutritional value and purify it, rendering it free of poison and disease. In addition, when an undead creature ends its turn in the light, it takes 1 radiant damage.
  <strong>Ghoulbane Oil</strong> (very rare), pg 52. This rusty-red gelatinous liquid glistens with tiny sparkling crystal flecks. The oil can coat one weapon or 5 pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, if a ghoul, ghast, or Darakhul (see Tome of Beasts) takes damage from the coated item, it takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.
  <strong>Ghoulbane Rod</strong> (rare), pg 75. Arcane glyphs decorate the spherical head of this tarnished rod, while engravings of cracked and broken skulls and bones circle its haft. When an undead creature is within 120 feet of the rod, the rod's arcane glyphs emit a soft glow. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's glyphs flare to life and the rod's magic activates. When an undead creature enters or starts its turn within 30 feet of the planted rod, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that aren't undead until the start of its next turn. If a ghoul fails this saving throw, it also takes a –2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions. The rod's magic remains active while planted in the ground, and after it has been active for a total of 10 minutes, its magic ceases to function until the next dawn. A creature can use an action to pull the rod from the ground, ending the effect early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from the rod's total active time.
  <strong>Giggling Orb</strong> (rare), pg 142. This glass sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and contains a swirling, yellow mist. You can use an action to throw the orb up to 60 feet. The orb shatters on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius of where the orb landed must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in fits of laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <strong>Girdle of Traveling Alchemy</strong> (very rare), pg 142. This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and vials. Once you have attuned to the girdle, these containers magically fill with the following liquids: - 2 flasks of alchemist's fire - 2 flasks of alchemist's ice* - 2 vials of acid - 2 jars of swarm repellent* - 1 vial of assassin's blood poison - 1 potion of climbing - 1 potion of healing Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical substances produced by the girdle lose their properties if they're transferred to another container before being used.
  <strong>Glamour Rings</strong> (uncommon), pg 75. These rings are made from twisted loops of gold and onyx and are always found in pairs. The rings' magic works only while you and another humanoid of the same size each wear one ring and are on the same plane of existence. While wearing a ring, you or the other humanoid can use an action to swap your appearances, if both of you are willing. This effect works like the Change Appearance effect of the alter self spell, except you can change your appearance to only look identical to each other. Your clothing and equipment don't change, and the effect lasts until one of you uses this property again or until one of you removes the ring.
  <strong>Glass Wand of Leng</strong> (rare), pg 75. The tip of this twisted clear glass wand is razorsharp. It can be wielded as a magic dagger that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand weighs 4 pounds and is roughly 18 inches long.

This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): arcane lock (2 charges), disguise self (1 charge), or tongues (3 charges).
  <strong>Glazed Blade</strong> (common), pg 24. A pleasant scent emerges from this weapon. While it is on your person, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with humanoids and fey.
  <strong>Gliding Cloak</strong> (uncommon), pg 142. By grasping the ends of the cloak while falling, you can glide up to 5 feet horizontally in any direction for every 1 foot you fall. You descend 60 feet per round but take no damage from falling while gliding in this way. A tailwind allows you to glide 10 feet per 1 foot descended, but a headwind forces you to only glide 5 feet per 2 feet descended.
  <strong>Gloomflower Corsage</strong> (very rare), pg 142. This black, six-petaled flower fits neatly on a garment's lapel or peeking out of a pocket. While wearing it, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, or frightened. While wearing the flower, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to invoke the corsage's power and cause one of the following effects: - When you speak the first command word, you gain blindsight out to a range of 120 feet for 1 hour. - When you speak the second command word, choose a target within 120 feet of you and make a ranged attack with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage. - When you speak the third command word, your form shifts and shimmers. For 1 minute, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight. Each time you use the flower, one of its petals curls in on itself. You can't use the flower if all of its petals are curled. The flower uncurls 1d6 petals daily at dusk.
  <strong>Gloves of the Magister</strong> (rare), pg 143. The backs of each of these black leather gloves are set with gold fittings as if to hold a jewel. While you wear the gloves, you can cast mage hand at will. You can affix an ioun stone into the fitting on a glove. While the stone is affixed, you gain the benefits of the stone as if you had it in orbit around your head. If you take an action to touch a creature, you can transfer the benefits of the ioun stone to that creature for 1 hour. While the creature is gifted the benefits, the stone turns gray and provides you with no benefits for the duration. You can use an action to end this effect and return power to the stone. The stone's benefits can also be dispelled from a creature as if they were a 7th-level spell. When the effect ends, the stone regains its color and provides you with its benefits once more.
  <strong>Gloves of the Walking Shade</strong> (very rare), pg 143. Each glove is actually comprised of three, black ivory rings (typically fitting the thumb, middle finger, and pinkie) which are connected to each other.

While wearing these gloves, you gain the following benefits: - You have resistance to necrotic damage. - You can spend one Hit Die during a short rest to remove one level of exhaustion instead of regaining hit points. - You can use an action to become a living shadow for 1 minute. For the duration, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you can take the Hide action as a bonus action while you are in dim light or darkness. Once used, this property of the gloves can't be used again until the next nightfall.
  <strong>Gnawing Spear</strong> (rare), pg 24. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this spear, its head animates, grows serrated teeth, and lodges itself in the target. While the spear is lodged in the target and you are wielding the spear, the target is grappled by you. At the start of each of your turns, the spear twists and grinds, dealing 2d6 piercing damage to the grappled target. If you release the spear, it remains lodged in the target, dealing damage each round as normal, but the target is no longer grappled by you. While the spear is lodged in a target, you can't make attacks with it. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to remove the spear by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The target takes 1d6 piercing damage when the spear is removed. You can use an action to speak the spear's command word, causing it to dislodge itself and fall into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

  <strong>Goggles of Firesight</strong> (uncommon), pg 143. The lenses of these combination fleshy and plantlike goggles extend a few inches away from the goggles on a pair of tentacles. While wearing these lenses, you can see through lightly obscured and heavily obscured areas without your vision being obscured, if those areas are obscured by fire, smoke, or fog. Other effects that would obscure your vision, such as rain or darkness, affect you normally. When you fail a saving throw against being blinded, you can use a reaction to call on the power within the goggles. If you do so, you succeed on the saving throw instead. The goggles can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Goggles of Shade</strong> (uncommon), pg 143. While wearing these dark lenses, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait and wear these goggles, you no longer suffer the penalties of Sunlight Sensitivity while in sunlight.
  <strong>Golden Bolt</strong> (uncommon), pg 24. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This crossbow doesn't have the loading property, and it doesn't require ammunition. Immediately after firing a bolt from this weapon, another golden bolt forms to take its place.
  <strong>Gorgon Scale</strong> (very rare), pg 24. The iron scales of this armor have a green-tinged iridescence. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have immunity to the petrified condition. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to imbue the hit with some of the armor's petrifying magic.

While wearing this cap, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb, and the cap deflects the first ranged attack made against you each round. In addition, when a creature attacks you while within 30 feet of you, it is illuminated and sheds red-hued dim light in a 50-foot radius until the end of its next turn. Any attack roll against an illuminated creature has advantage if the attacker can see it.
  <strong>Grasping Cloak</strong> (very rare), pg 143. Made of strips of black leather, this cloak always shines as if freshly oiled. The strips writhe and grasp at nearby creatures. While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to grapple a creature no more than one size larger than you within 5 feet of you. The strips make the grapple attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target is grappled by the cloak, leaving your hands free to perform other tasks or actions that require both hands. However, you are still considered to be grappling a creature, limiting your movement as normal. The cloak can grapple only one creature at a time. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to aid you in grappling. If you do so, you have advantage on your next attack roll made to grapple a creature. While grappling a creature in this way, you have advantage on the contested check if a creature attempts to escape your grapple.

  <strong>Grave Reagent</strong> (uncommon), pg 52. This luminous green concoction creates an undead servant. If you spend 1 minute anointing the corpse of a Small or Medium humanoid, this arcane solution imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a zombie under your control (the GM has the zombie's statistics). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally command the zombie if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the zombie will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the zombie only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the zombie continues to follow it until its task is complete. The zombie is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it.

As an action, one dose can be applied to or swallowed by a clockwork creature or device. The clockwork creature or device ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed for 8 hours. As an action, the clockwork creature, or a creature holding a clockwork device, can gain the effect of the haste spell until the end of its next turn (no concentration required).

  <strong>Hallowed Effigy</strong> (rare), pg 144. This foot-long totem, crafted from the bones and skull of a Tiny woodland beast bound in thin leather strips, serves as a boon for you and your allies and as a stinging trap to those who threaten you. The totem has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, it can't regain charges again until a druid performs a 24-hour ritual, which involves the sacrifice of a Tiny woodland beast. You can use an action to secure the effigy on any natural organic substrate (such as dirt, mud, grass, and so on). While secured in this way, it pulses with primal energy on initiative count 20 each round, expending 1 charge. When it pulses, you and each creature friendly to you within 15 feet of the totem regains 1d6 hit points, and each creature hostile to you within 15 feet of the totem must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. It continues to pulse each round until you pick it up, it runs out of charges, or it is destroyed. The totem has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If it drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
  <strong>Hallucinatory Dust</strong> (rare), pg 145. This small packet contains black pollen from a Gloomflower (see Creature Codex). Hazy images swirl around the pollen when observed outside the packet. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to blow the dust from your palm, each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature sees terrible visions, manifesting its fears and anxieties for 1 minute. While affected, it takes 2d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns and must spend its action to make one melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it, other than you or itself. If the creature can't make a melee attack, it takes the Dodge action. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature becomes incapacitated until the end of its next turn as the visions fill its mind then quickly fade. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the dust's psychic damage falls unconscious and is stable. When the creature regains consciousness, it is permanently plagued by hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks until cured by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
  <strong>Hammer of Decrees</strong> (rare), pg 145. This adamantine hammer was part of a set of smith's tools used to create weapons of law for an ancient dwarven civilization.

  <strong>Handy Scroll Quiver</strong> (common), pg 145. This belt quiver is wide enough to pass a rolled scroll through the opening. Containing an extra dimensional space, the quiver can hold up to 25 scrolls and weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Placing a scroll in the quiver follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving a scroll from the quiver requires you to use an action. When you reach into the quiver for a specific scroll, that scroll is always magically on top. The quiver has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the quiver ruptures and is destroyed. If the quiver is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If a breathing creature is placed within the quiver, the creature can survive for up to 5 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the quiver inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

This instrument has 3 charges for the following properties. The instrument regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Hat of Mental Acuity</strong> (rare), pg 146. This well-crafted cap appears to be standard wear for academics. Embroidered on the edge of the inside lining in green thread are sigils.

If you are proficient in an Intelligence or Wisdom-based skill, you double your proficiency bonus for the skill.
  <strong>Hazelwood Wand</strong> (common), pg 75. You can use this wand as a spellcasting focus. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast the goodberry spell while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges to transform the berries into hazelnuts, which restore 2 hit points instead of 1. The spell is otherwise unchanged. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals lightning damage while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals 1 extra lightning damage.
  <strong>Headdress of Majesty</strong> (rare), pg 146. This elaborate headpiece is adorned with small gemstones and thin strips of gold that frame your head like a radiant halo.

  <strong>Headrest of the Cattle Queens</strong> (uncommon), pg 146. This polished and curved wooden headrest is designed to keep the user's head comfortably elevated while sleeping. If you sleep at least 6 hours as part of a long rest while using the headrest, you regain 1 additional spent Hit Die, and your exhaustion level is reduced by 2 (rather than 1) when you finish the long rest.
  <strong>Headscarf of the Oasis</strong> (uncommon), pg 146.

Pulling the headscarf on or off your mouth and nose requires an action.

They are recognizable by their black, hooded robes, silver masks, and the rods they carry as weapons. These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together. The combined powers of this trinity of items make a Justicar a formidable force in the pursuit of law and order.

An intricate engraving of a warrior's sword piercing a dragon's chest is detailed along the front of this untarnished silver locket.

This dubious old book, bound in heavy leather with iron hasps, details the forbidden secrets and monstrous blasphemy of a multitude of nightmare cults that worship nameless and ghastly entities.

Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target. An untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries.

  <strong>Potion of Air Breathing</strong> (uncommon), pg 55. This potion's pale blue fluid smells like salty air, and a seagull's feather floats in it. You can breathe air for 1 hour after drinking this potion. If you could already breathe air, this potion has no effect.
  <strong>Potion of Bad Taste</strong> (common), pg 55. This brown, sludgy potion tastes extremely foul. When you drink this potion, the taste of your flesh is altered to be unpalatable for 1 hour. During this time, if a creature hits you with a bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or spend its next action gagging and retching. A creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower avoids biting you again unless compelled or commanded by an outside force or if you attack it.
  <strong>Potion of Bouncing</strong> (uncommon), pg 55. A small, red sphere bobs up and down in the clear, effervescent liquid inside this bottle but disappears when the bottle is opened. When you drink this potion, your body becomes rubbery, and you are immune to falling damage for 1 hour. If you fall at least 10 feet, your body bounces back the same distance. As a reaction while falling, you can angle your fall and position your legs to redirect this distance. For example, if you fall 60 feet, you can redirect your bounce to propel you 30 feet up and 30 feet forward from the position where you landed.
  <strong>Potion of Buoyancy</strong> (common), pg 56. When you drink this clear, effervescent liquid, your body becomes unnaturally buoyant for 1 hour. When you are immersed in water or other liquids, you rise to the surface (at a rate of up to 30 feet per round) to float and bob there. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to swim or stay afloat in rough water, and you automatically succeed on such checks in calm waters.
  <strong>Potion of Dire Cleansing</strong> (uncommon), pg 56. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, you have resistance to poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and poisoned. In addition, if you are poisoned, this potion neutralizes the poison. Known for its powerful, somewhat burning smell, this potion is difficult to drink, requiring a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw to drink it. On a failure, you are poisoned for 10 minutes and don't gain the benefits of the potion.
  <strong>Potion of Ebbing Strength</strong> (uncommon), pg 56. When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 25 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score. The recipe for this potion is flawed and infused with dangerous Void energies. When you drink this potion, you are also poisoned. While poisoned, you take 2d4 poison damage at the end of each minute. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while poisoned, you have disadvantage on death saving throws. This bubbling, pale blue potion is commonly used by the derro and is almost always paired with a Potion of Dire Cleansing or Holy Verdant Bat Droppings (see page 147). Warriors who use this potion without a method of removing the poison don't intend to return home from battle.
  <strong>Potion of Effulgence</strong> (common), pg 56. When you drink this potion, your skin glows with radiance, and you are filled with joy and bliss for 1 minute. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. While glowing, you are blinded and have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. If a creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait starts its turn in the bright light you shed, it takes 2d4 radiant damage. This potion's golden liquid sparkles with motes of sunlight.
  <strong>Potion of Empowering Truth</strong> (rare), pg 56. A withered snake's tongue floats in the shimmering gold liquid within this crystalline vial. When you drink this potion, you regain one expended spell slot or one expended use of a class feature, such as Divine Sense, Rage, Wild Shape, or other feature with limited uses. Until you finish a long rest, you can't speak a deliberate lie. You are aware of this effect after drinking the potion. Your words can be evasive, as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.
  <strong>Potion of Freezing Fog</strong> (uncommon), pg 56. After drinking this potion, you can use an action to exhale a cloud of icy fog in a 20-foot cube originating from you. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 cold damage. The effects of this potion end after you have exhaled one fog cloud or 1 hour has passed. This potion has a gray, cloudy appearance and swirls vigorously when shaken.
  <strong>Potion of Malleability</strong> (uncommon), pg 56. The glass bottle holding this thick, red liquid is strangely pliable, and compresses in your hand under the slightest pressure while it still holds the magical liquid. When you drink this potion, your body becomes extremely flexible and adaptable to pressure. For 1 hour, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage, can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature two sizes smaller than you, and have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape a grapple.
  <strong>Potion of Sand Form</strong> (very rare), pg 56. This potion's container holds a gritty liquid that moves and pours like water filled with fine particles of sand. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. While in this gaseous form, your appearance is that of a vortex of spiraling sand instead of a misty cloud. In addition, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in a sandy environment, and, while motionless in a sandy environment, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary swirl of sand.
  <strong>Potion of Skating</strong> (common), pg 57. For 1 hour after you drink this potion, you can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement. This sparkling blue liquid contains tiny snowflakes that disappear when shaken.
  <strong>Potion of Transparency</strong> (common), pg 57. The liquid in this vial is clear like water, and it gives off a slight iridescent sheen when shaken or swirled. When you drink this potion, you and everything you are wearing and carrying turn transparent, but not completely invisible, for 10 minutes. During this time, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and ranged attacks against you have disadvantage.
  <strong>Potion of Worg Form</strong> (rare), pg 57. Small flecks of brown hair are suspended in this clear, syrupy liquid. When you drink this potion, you transform into a worg for 1 hour. This works like the polymorph spell, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. While in worg form, you can speak normally, and you can cast spells that have only verbal components. This transformation doesn't give you knowledge of the Goblin or Worg languages, and you are able to speak and understand those languages only if you knew them before the transformation.
  <strong>Prayer Mat</strong> (uncommon), pg 165. This small rug is woven with intricate patterns that depict religious iconography. When you attune to it, the iconography and the mat's colors change to the iconography and colors most appropriate for your deity. If you spend 10 minutes praying to your deity while kneeling on this mat, you regain one expended use of Channel Divinity. The mat can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Primal Doom</strong> (varies), pg 165. A murky liquid or smoke churns inside this small, glass globe. Typically, 1d3 primal dooms are found together. You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet of where the globe landed must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage. If at least one creature failed the saving throw, the primal essence of the Lower Planes within the globe coalesces into a fiend, depending on the type of globe. The fiend lasts for 1 minute and acts on its own, but it views you and your allies as its allies. Primal Doom of Anguish (Uncommon). This globe deals 2d6 psychic damage and summons a dretch or a lemure (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Pain (Rare). This globe deals 4d6 psychic damage and summons a barbed devil or vrock (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Rage (Very Rare). This globe deals 6d6 psychic damage and summons a bone devil or glabrezu (your choice) on a failed saving throw.
  <strong>Primordial Scale</strong> (uncommon), pg 31. This armor is fashioned from the scales of a great, subterranean beast shunned by the gods. While wearing it, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the armor increases its range by 60 feet, but you have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you are in sunlight. In addition, while wearing this armor, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by agents of the gods, such as celestials, fiends, clerics, and cultists.
  <strong>Prospecting Compass</strong> (common), pg 166. This battered, old compass has engravings of lumps of ore and natural crystalline minerals. While holding this compass, you can use an action to name a type of metal or stone. The compass points to the nearest naturally occurring source of that metal or stone for 1 hour or until you name a different type of metal or stone. The compass can point to cut gemstones, but it can't point to processed metals, such as iron swords or gold coins. The compass can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Quick-Change Mirror</strong> (uncommon), pg 166. This utilitarian, rectangular standing mirror measures 4 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Despite its plain appearance, the mirror allows creatures to quickly change outfits. While in front of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the mirror's command word to be clothed in an outfit stored in the mirror. The outfit you are currently wearing is stored in the mirror or falls to the floor at your feet (your choice). The mirror can hold up to 12 outfits. An outfit must be a set of clothing or armor. An outfit can include other wearable items, such as a belt with pouches, a backpack, headwear, or footwear, but it can't include weapons or other carried items unless the weapon or carried item is sheathed, stored in a backpack, pocket, or pouch, or similarly attached to the outfit. The extent of how many attachments an outfit can have before it is considered more than one outfit or it is no longer considered an outfit is at the GM's discretion. To store an outfit you are wearing in the mirror, you must spend at least 1 minute rotating slowly in front of the mirror and speak the mirror's second command word. You can use a bonus action to speak a third command word to cause the mirror to display the outfits it contains. When found, the mirror contains 1d10 + 2 outfits. If the mirror is destroyed, all outfits it contains fall in a heap at its base.
  <strong>Quill of Scribing</strong> (common), pg 166. This quill is fashioned from the feather of some exotic beast, often a giant eagle, griffon, or hippogriff. When you take an action to speak the command word, the quill animates, transcribing each word spoken by you, and up to three other creatures you designate, onto whatever material is placed before it until the command word is spoken again, or it has scribed 250 words. Once used, the quill can't be used again for 8 hours.
  <strong>Quilted Bridge</strong> (common), pg 166. A practiced hand sewed together a collection of cloth remnants from magical garb to make this colorful and warm blanket. You can use an action to unfold it and pour out three drops of wine in tribute to its maker. If you do so, the blanket becomes a 5-foot wide, 10-foot-long bridge as sturdy as steel. You can fold the bridge back up as an action.
  <strong>Radiance Bomb</strong> (uncommon), pg 166. This small apple-sized globule is made from a highly reflective silver material and has a single, golden rune etched on it. Typically, 1d4 + 4 radiance bombs are found together. You can use an action to throw the globule up to 60 feet. The globule explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the globule landed must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <strong>Radiant Bracers</strong> (rare), pg 167. These bronze bracers are engraved with the image of an ankh with outstretched wings. While wearing these bracers, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and you can use an action to speak the command word while crossing the bracers over your chest. If you do so, each undead that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. On a failure, an undead creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. This feature works like the cleric's Turn Undead class feature, except it can't be used to destroy undead. The bracers can't be used to turn undead again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Radiant Libram</strong> (legendary), pg 167. The gilded pages of this holy tome are bound between thin plates of moonstone crystal that emit a gentle incandescence. Aureate celestial runes adorn nearly every inch of its blessed surface. In addition, while you are attuned to the book, the spells written in it count as prepared spells and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. You don't gain additional spell slots from this feature. The following spells are written in the book: beacon of hope, bless, calm emotions, commune, cure wounds, daylight, detect evil and good, divine favor, flame strike, gentle repose, guidance, guiding bolt, heroism, lesser restoration, light, produce flame, protection from evil and good, sacred flame, sanctuary, and spare the dying. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Once used, this property of the book can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Rain of Chaos</strong> (uncommon), pg 31. This magic weapon imbues arrows fired from it with random energies. When you hit with an attack using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage. Roll a 1d8. The number rolled determines the damage type of the extra damage. | d8 | Damage Type | | --- | ----------- | | 1 | Acid | | 2 | Cold | | 3 | Fire | | 4 | Lightning | | 5 | Necrotic | | 6 | Poison | | 7 | Radiant | | 8 | Thunder |
  <strong>Rainbow Extract</strong> (common), pg 57. This thin, oily liquid shimmers with the colors of the spectrum. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, you can use an action to change the color of your hair, skin, eyes, or all three to any color or mixture of colors in any hue, pattern, or saturation you choose. You can change the colors as often as you want for the duration, but the color changes disappear at the end of the duration.
  <strong>Ravager's Axe</strong> (very rare), pg 31. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Any attack with this axe that hits a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried is a critical hit. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this axe, the target takes an extra 1d10 cold damage and 1d10 necrotic damage as the axe briefly becomes a rift to the Void.
  <strong>Recondite Shield</strong> (uncommon), pg 76. While wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action to create a weightless, magic shield that shimmers with arcane energy. You must be proficient with shields to wield this semitranslucent shield, and you wield it in the same hand that wears the ring. The shield lasts for 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required). Once used, you can't use the ring in this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Recording Book</strong> (uncommon), pg 167. This book, which hosts a dormant Bookkeeper (see Creature Codex), appears to be a journal filled with empty pages. You can use an action to place the open book on a surface and speak its command word to activate it. It remains active until you use an action to speak the command word again. The book records all things said within 60 feet of it. It can distinguish voices and notes those as it records. The book can hold up to 12 hours' worth of conversation. You can use an action to speak a second command word to remove up to 1 hour of recordings in the book, while a third command word removes all the book's recordings. Any creature, other than you or targets you designate, that peruses the book finds the pages blank.
  <strong>Reef Splitter</strong> (very rare), pg 31. The head of this warhammer is constructed of undersea volcanic rock and etched with images of roaring flames and boiling water. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the hammer erupts with magma, and the target takes an extra 4d6 fire damage. In addition, if the target is underwater, the water around it begins to boil with the heat of your blow, and each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target takes 2d6 fire damage.
  <strong>Relocation Cable</strong> (uncommon), pg 168. This 60-foot length of fine wire cable weighs 2 pounds. If you hold one end of the cable and use an action to speak its command word, the other end plunges into the ground, burrowing through dirt, sand, snow, mud, ice, and similar material to emerge from the ground at a destination you can see up to its maximum length away. The cable can't burrow through solid rock. On the turn it is activated, you can use a bonus action to magically travel from one end of the cable to the other, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other end. On subsequent turns, any creature in contact with one end of the cable can use an action to appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other end of it. A creature magically traveling from one end of the cable to the other doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can retract the cable by using a bonus action to speak the command word a second time.
  <strong>Resolute Bracer</strong> (uncommon), pg 168. This ornamental bracer features a reservoir sewn into its lining. As an action, you can fill the reservoir with a single potion or vial of liquid, such as a potion of healing or antitoxin. While attuned to this bracer, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word and absorb the liquid as if you had consumed it. Liquid stored in the bracer for longer than 8 hours evaporates.
  <strong>Retribution Armor</strong> (very rare), pg 32. Etchings of flames adorn this breastplate, which is wrapped in chains of red gold, silver, and black iron. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, if a creature scores a critical hit against you, you have advantage on any attacks against that creature until the end of your next turn or until you score a critical hit against that creature. - You have resistance to necrotic damage, and you are immune to poison damage. - You can't be charmed or poisoned, and you don't suffer from exhaustion. - You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. - You have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead. - You can use an action to sense the direction of your killer. This works like the locate creature spell, except you can sense only the creature that killed you. You rise as an undead only if your death was caused with intent; accidental deaths or deaths from unintended consequences (such as dying from a disease unintentionally passed to you) don't activate this property of the armor. You exist in this deathly state for up to 1 week per Hit Die or until you exact revenge on your killer, at which time your body crumbles to ash and you finally die. You can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.
  <strong>Revenant's Shawl</strong> (uncommon), pg 168. This shawl is made of old raven feathers woven together with elk sinew and small bones. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the shawl, it explodes in a burst of freezing wind. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You then regain 4d6 hit points, and the shawl disintegrates into fine black powder.
  <strong>Rift Orb</strong> (rare), pg 168. This orb is a sphere of obsidian 3 inches in diameter. When you speak the command word in Void Speech, you can throw the sphere as an action to a point within 60 feet. When the sphere reaches the point you choose or if it strikes a solid object on the way, it immediately stops and generates a tiny rift into the Void. The area within 20 feet of the rift orb becomes difficult terrain, and gravity begins drawing everything in the affected area toward the rift. Each creature in the area at the start of its turn, or when it enters the area for the first time on a turn, must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the rift. A creature that touches the rift takes 4d10 necrotic damage. Unattended objects in the area are pulled 10 feet toward the rift at the start of your turn. Nonmagical objects pulled into the rift are destroyed. The rift orb functions for 1 minute, after which time it becomes inert. It can't be used again until the following midnight.
  <strong>Ring of Arcane Adjustment</strong> (uncommon), pg 76. This stylized silver ring is favored by spellcasters accustomed to fighting creatures capable of shrugging off most spells. The ring has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has only one target and the target succeeds on the saving throw, you can use a reaction and expend 1 charge from the ring to change the spell's target to a new target within the spell's range. The new target is then affected by the spell, but the new target has advantage on the saving throw. You can't move the spell more than once this way, even if the new target succeeds on the saving throw. You can't move a spell that affects an area, that has multiple targets, that requires an attack roll, or that allows the target to make a saving throw to reduce, but not prevent, the effects of the spell, such as blight or feeblemind.
  <strong>Ring of Bravado</strong> (uncommon), pg 77. This polished brass ring has 3 charges. While wearing the ring, you are inspired to daring acts that risk life and limb, especially if such acts would impress or intimidate others who witness them. When you choose a course of action that could result in serious harm or possible death (your GM has final say in if an action qualifies), you can expend 1 of the ring's charges to roll a d10 and add the number rolled to any d20 roll you make to achieve success or avoid damage, such as a Strength (Athletics) check to scale a sheer cliff and avoid falling or a Dexterity saving throw made to run through a hallway filled with swinging blades. The ring regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, if you fail on a roll boosted by the ring, and you failed the roll by only 1, the ring regains 1 expended charge, as its magic recognizes a valiant effort.
  <strong>Ring of Deceiver's Warning</strong> (common), pg 77. This copper ring is set with a round stone of blue quartz. While you wear the ring, the stone's color changes to red if a shapechanger comes within 30 feet of you.

  <strong>Ring of Dragon's Discernment</strong> (uncommon), pg 77. A large, orange cat's eye gem is held in the fittings of this ornate silver ring, looking as if it is grasped by scaled talons. While wearing this ring, your senses are sharpened. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you can take the Search action as a bonus action. In addition, you are able to discern the value of any object made of precious metals or minerals or rare materials by handling it for 1 round.
  <strong>Ring of Featherweight Weapons</strong> (uncommon), pg 77. If you normally have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons with the Heavy property due to your size, you don't have disadvantage on those attack rolls while you wear this ring. This ring has no effect on you if you are Medium or larger or if you don't normally have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.
  <strong>Ring of Giant Mingling</strong> (rare), pg 77. While wearing this ring, your size changes to match the size of those around you. If you are a Large creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Medium creatures, this ring makes you Medium. Similarly, if you are a Medium creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Large creatures, this ring makes you Large. These effects work like the effects of the enlarge/reduce spell, except they persist as long as you wear the ring and satisfy the conditions.
  <strong>Ring of Hoarded Life</strong> (uncommon), pg 77. This ring stores hit points sacrificed to it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 30 hit points at a time. When found, it contains 2d10 stored hit points. While wearing this ring, you can use an action to spend one or more Hit Dice, up to your maximum Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the ring stores the total, up to 30 hit points. This hit point maximum reduction can't be removed with the greater restoration spell or similar magic and lasts as long as hit points remain stored in the ring. You can't store hit points in the ring if you don't have blood. When hit points are stored in the ring, you can cause one of the following effects: - You can use a bonus action to remove stored hit points from the ring and regain that number of hit points. - You can use an action to remove stored hit points from the ring while touching the ring to a creature. If you do so, the creature regains hit points equal to the amount of hit points you removed from the ring. - When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can use a reaction to empty the ring of stored hit points and regain hit points equal to that amount. Hit Dice spent on this ring's features can't be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.

In addition, you can use an action and expend 1 of the ring's charges to command a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to kneel before you. The target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target spends its next turn moving toward you by the shortest and most direct route then falls prone and ends its turn.
  <strong>Ring of Light's Comfort</strong> (uncommon), pg 78. A disc of white chalcedony sits within an encompassing band of black onyx, set into fittings on this pewter ring. While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to speak the ring's command word, causing it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The ring automatically sheds this light if you start your turn within 60 feet of an undead or lycanthrope. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word. In addition, you can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by undead or lycanthropes.
  <strong>Ring of Night's Solace</strong> (uncommon), pg 78. A disc of black onyx sits within an encompassing band of white chalcedony, set into fittings on this pewter ring. While wearing this ring in bright light, you are draped in a comforting cloak of shadow, protecting you from the harshest glare.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.

The ring can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Ring of Sealing</strong> (very rare), pg 78. This ring appears to be made of golden chain links. It has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a melee attack while wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 of the ring's charges to cause mystical golden chains to spring from the ground and wrap around the creature. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the magical chains hold the target firmly in place, and it is restrained. The target can't move or be moved by any means. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, if the target fails three consecutive saving throws, the chains bind the target permanently. A successful dispel magic (DC 17) cast on the chains destroys them.
  <strong>Ring of Shadows</strong> (common), pg 78. While wearing this ebony ring in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. When you roll a 20 on a Dexterity (Stealth) check, the ring's magic ceases to function until the next dawn.

The types of spells you can counter and the amount of hit points you lose depend on the type of ring you are wearing. | d8 | School | | --- | ------------- | | 1 | Abjuration | | 2 | Conjuration | | 3 | Divination | | 4 | Enchantment | | 5 | Evocation | | 6 | Illusion | | 7 | Necromancy | | 8 | Transmutation |
  <strong>Ring of Stored Vitality</strong> (uncommon), pg 79. While you are attuned to and wearing this ring of polished, white chalcedony, you can feed some of your vitality into the ring to charge it. You can use an action to suffer 1 level of exhaustion. For each level of exhaustion you suffer, the ring regains 1 charge. The ring can store up to 3 charges. As the ring increases in charges, its color reddens, becoming a deep red when it has 3 charges. Your level of exhaustion can be reduced by normal means. If you already suffer from 3 or more levels of exhaustion, you can't suffer another level of exhaustion to restore a charge to the ring.

When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti’s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft— weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade—and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan’s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items.

You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don’t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time.

While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn’t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor’s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti’s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor’s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form.

It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. If the shadow canine is reduced to 0 hit points, the canine reverts to its original form, and the muzzle is destroyed. At the end of the duration or if you remove the muzzle (by stroking the canine's snout), the canine reverts to its original form, and the muzzle remains intact.

Each point on this branching spear has a history of its own and is infused with the pain of loss and the glory of military service. When wielded in battle, each of the small, branching spear points attached to the polearm's shaft pulses with a warm glow and burns with the desire to protect the righteous.

While attuned to and carrying this item, a spectral representation of the beast walks beside you, resembling the sacrificed creature's likeness in its prime. The specter follows you at all times and can be seen by all. You can use a bonus action to dismiss or summon the specter.

On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.                                                                                      | | 02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | | 11-20 | A treant sprouts.

It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM's choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.                                                                     | | 81-90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up.

  <strong>Bag of Devouring</strong> (very rare). This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.  The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.  Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.  If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
  <strong>Bag of Holding</strong> (uncommon). This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.  If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.  Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
  <strong>Bag of Tricks</strong> (uncommon). This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.  You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color.  The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.  Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

  <strong>Bead of Force</strong> (rare). This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.  You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.  An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
  <strong>Belt of Dwarvenkind</strong> (rare). While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:  * Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. * You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.

If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:  * You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. * You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. * You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.
  <strong>Belt of Giant Strength</strong> (varies). While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.  | Type              | Strength | Rarity    | |-------------------|----------|-----------| | Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      | | Stone/frost giant | 23       | Very rare | | Fire giant        | 25       | Very rare | | Cloud giant       | 27       | Legendary | | Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |

In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.  Curse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.  Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
  <strong>Boots of Elvenkind</strong> (uncommon). While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
  <strong>Boots of Levitation</strong> (rare). While you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.
  <strong>Boots of Speed</strong> (rare). While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.  When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
  <strong>Boots of Striding and Springing</strong> (uncommon). While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn't reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can't jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.

While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:  * You have resistance to cold damage. * You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. * You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit.

The broom stops hovering when you land.  You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
  <strong>Candle of Invocation</strong> (very rare). This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.  | d20   | Alignment       | |-------|-----------------| | 1-2   | Chaotic evil    | | 3-4   | Chaotic neutral | | 5-7   | Chaotic good    | | 8-9   | Neutral evil    | | 10-11 | Neutral         | | 12-13 | Neutral good    | | 14-15 | Lawful evil     | | 16-17 | Lawful neutral  | | 18-20 | Lawful good     |  The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.  While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st* level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.  Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.  Crystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures.

While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.
  <strong>Cube of Force</strong> (rare). This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.  You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.  If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

  <strong>Cubic Gate</strong> (legendary). This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.  You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.  The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Dagger of Venom</strong> (rare). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Dancing Sword</strong> (very rare). You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.  While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.  After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.
  <strong>Decanter of Endless Water</strong> (uncommon). This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.  You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:  * "Stream" produces 1 gallon of water. * "Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water. * "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
  <strong>Deck of Illusions</strong> (uncommon). This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.  The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.  An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.  The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.  | Playing Card      | Illusion                         | |-------------------|----------------------------------| | Ace of hearts     | Red dragon                       | | King of hearts    | Knight and four guards           | | Queen of hearts   | Succubus or incubus              | | Jack of hearts    | Druid                            | | Ten of hearts     | Cloud giant                      | | Nine of hearts    | Ettin                            | | Eight of hearts   | Bugbear                          | | Two of hearts     | Goblin                           | | Ace of diamonds   | Beholder                         | | King of diamonds  | Archmage and mage apprentice     | | Queen of diamonds | Night hag                        | | Jack of diamonds  | Assassin                         | | Ten of diamonds   | Fire giant                       | | Nine of diamonds  | Ogre mage                        | | Eight of diamonds | Gnoll                            | | Two of diamonds   | Kobold                           | | Ace of spades     | Lich                             | | King of spades    | Priest and two acolytes          | | Queen of spades   | Medusa                           | | Jack of spades    | Veteran                          | | Ten of spades     | Frost giant                      | | Nine of spades    | Troll                            | | Eight of spades   | Hobgoblin                        | | Two of spades     | Goblin                           | | Ace of clubs      | Iron golem                       | | King of clubs     | Bandit captain and three bandits | | Queen of clubs    | Erinyes                          | | Jack of clubs     | Berserker                        | | Ten of clubs      | Hill giant                       | | Nine of clubs     | Ogre                             | | Eight of clubs    | Orc                              | | Two of clubs      | Kobold                           | | Jokers (2)        | You (the deck's owner)           |
  <strong>Deck of Many Things</strong> (legendary). Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.  Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.  Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.  | Playing Card       | Card        | |--------------------|-------------| | Ace of diamonds    | Vizier\*    | | King of diamonds   | Sun         | | Queen of diamonds  | Moon        | | Jack of diamonds   | Star        | | Two of diamonds    | Comet\*     | | Ace of hearts      | The Fates\* | | King of hearts     | Throne      | | Queen of hearts    | Key         | | Jack of hearts     | Knight      | | Two of hearts      | Gem\*       | | Ace of clubs       | Talons\*    | | King of clubs      | The Void    | | Queen of clubs     | Flames      | | Jack of clubs      | Skull       | | Two of clubs       | Idiot\*     | | Ace of spades      | Donjon\*    | | King of spades     | Ruin        | | Queen of spades    | Euryale     | | Jack of spades     | Rogue       | | Two of spades      | Balance\*   | | Joker (with TM)    | Fool\*      | | Joker (without TM) | Jester      |  \*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards  Balance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.  Comet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.  Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.  Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.  The Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.  Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.  Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.  Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.  Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.  Jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.  Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.  Knight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.  Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.  Rogue. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.  Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.  Skull. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.  #
  <strong>Defender</strong> (legendary). You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.
  <strong>Demon Armor</strong> (very rare). While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.  Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
  <strong>Dimensional Shackles</strong> (rare). You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
  <strong>Dragon Scale Mail</strong> (very rare). Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).  Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.  | Dragon | Resistance | |--------|------------| | Black  | Acid       | | Blue   | Lightning  | | Brass  | Fire       | | Bronze | Lightning  | | Copper | Acid       | | Gold   | Fire       | | Green  | Poison     | | Red    | Fire       | | Silver | Cold       | | White  | Cold       |
  <strong>Dragon Slayer</strong> (rare). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.
  <strong>Dust of Disappearance</strong> (uncommon). Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.
  <strong>Dust of Dryness</strong> (uncommon). This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.  Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.  An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  <strong>Dust of Sneezing and Choking</strong> (uncommon). Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.  When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.
  <strong>Dwarven Plate</strong> (very rare). While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.
  <strong>Dwarven Thrower</strong> (very rare). You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.
  <strong>Efficient Quiver</strong> (uncommon). Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.  You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
  <strong>Efreeti Bottle</strong> (very rare). This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.  | d100   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 01-10  | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | | 11-90  | The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. | | 91-100 | The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
  <strong>Elemental Gem</strong> (uncommon). This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem's magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.  | Gem            | Summoned Elemental | |----------------|--------------------| | Blue sapphire  | Air elemental      | | Yellow diamond | Earth elemental    | | Red corundum   | Fire elemental     | | Emerald        | Water elemental    |
  <strong>Elven Chain</strong> (rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.
  <strong>Eversmoking Bottle</strong> (uncommon). Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.  The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.
  <strong>Eyes of Charming</strong> (uncommon). These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Eyes of Minute Seeing</strong> (uncommon). These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.
  <strong>Eyes of the Eagle</strong> (uncommon). These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
  <strong>Feather Token</strong> (rare). This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single* use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.  | d100   | Feather Token | |--------|---------------| | 01-20  | Anchor        | | 21-35  | Bird          | | 36-50  | Fan           | | 51-65  | Swan boat     | | 66-90  | Tree          | | 91-100  | Whip          |  Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.  Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.  Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.  Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot* wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.  Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.  Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.
  <strong>Figurine of Wondrous Power</strong> (rarity by figurine). A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.  The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.  Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.  Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.  > ##### Giant Fly > Armor Class 11   > Hit Points 19 (3d10 + 3)   > Speed 30 ft., fly 60 ft. > > | STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    | > |---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------| > | 14 (+2) | 13 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 10 (+0) | 3 (-4) | > > Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10   > Languages -  Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:  * The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. * The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed. * The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.  Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.  If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.  Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.  Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.
  <strong>Flame Tongue</strong> (rare). You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
  <strong>Folding Boat</strong> (rare). This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.  One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.  The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.  When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.  The third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.
  <strong>Frost Brand</strong> (very rare). When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to fire damage.  In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.  When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per hour.
  <strong>Gauntlets of Ogre Power</strong> (uncommon). Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.
  <strong>Gem of Brightness</strong> (uncommon). This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:  * The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem. * The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. * The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30* foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.  When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
  <strong>Gem of Seeing</strong> (rare). This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem's command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have truesight out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.  The gem regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Giant Slayer</strong> (rare). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.
  <strong>Glamoured Studded Leather</strong> (rare). While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.
  <strong>Gloves of Missile Snaring</strong> (uncommon). These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
  <strong>Gloves of Swimming and Climbing</strong> (uncommon). While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.
  <strong>Goggles of Night</strong> (uncommon). While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
  <strong>Hammer of Thunderbolts</strong> (legendary). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement). You must be wearing a belt of giant strength (any variety) and gauntlets of ogre power to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.  The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Handy Haversack</strong> (rare). This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.  Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.  The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.  Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
  <strong>Hat of Disguise</strong> (uncommon). While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.
  <strong>Headband of Intellect</strong> (uncommon). Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.
  <strong>Helm of Brilliance</strong> (very rare). This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.  You gain the following benefits while wearing it:  * You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. * As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. * As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage. * As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.  Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.
  <strong>Helm of Comprehending Languages</strong> (uncommon). While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.
  <strong>Helm of Telepathy</strong> (uncommon). While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.  While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Helm of Teleportation</strong> (rare). This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the teleport spell from it. The helm regains 1d3  expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Holy Avenger</strong> (legendary). You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.  While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.
  <strong>Horn of Blasting</strong> (rare). You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
  <strong>Horn of Valhalla</strong> (rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze) or legendary (iron)). You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.  | d100   | Horn Type | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement                          | |--------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------| | 01-40  | Silver    | 2d4 + 2             | None                                 | | 41-75  | Brass     | 3d4 + 3             | Proficiency with all simple weapons  | | 76-90  | Bronze    | 4d4 + 4             | Proficiency with all medium armor    | | 91-00  | Iron      | 5d4 + 5             | Proficiency with all martial weapons |  If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
  <strong>Horseshoes of a Zephyr</strong> (very rare). These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.
  <strong>Horseshoes of Speed</strong> (rare). These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature's walking speed by 30 feet.
  <strong>Immovable Rod</strong> (uncommon). This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
  <strong>Instant Fortress</strong> (rare). You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.  The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.  Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,  immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.
  <strong>Ioun Stone</strong> (varies). An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.  When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.  Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.  Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.  Awareness (Rare). You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.  Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.  Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.  Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.  Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.  Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.  Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.  Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.  Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.  Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.  Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.  While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.  Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.  Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.
  <strong>Iron Bands of Binding</strong> (rare). This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Iron Flask</strong> (legendary). This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.  You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.  | d100  | Contents          | |-------|-------------------| | 1-50  | Empty             | | 51-54 | Demon (type 1)    | | 55-58 | Demon (type 2)    | | 59-62 | Demon (type 3)    | | 63-64 | Demon (type 4)    | | 65    | Demon (type 5)    | | 66    | Demon (type 6)    | | 67    | Deva              | | 68-69 | Devil (greater)   | | 70-73 | Devil (lesser)    | | 74-75 | Djinni            | | 76-77 | Efreeti           | | 78-83 | Elemental (any)   | | 84-86 | Invisible stalker | | 87-90 | Night hag         | | 91    | Planetar          | | 92-95 | Salamander        | | 96    | Solar             | | 97-99 | Succubus/incubus  | | 100   | Xorn              |
  <strong>Javelin of Lightning</strong> (uncommon). This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.  The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.
  <strong>Lantern of Revealing</strong> (uncommon). While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5* foot radius.
  <strong>Luck Blade</strong> (legendary). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.  Luck. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  Wish. The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.
  <strong>Mace of Disruption</strong> (rare). When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
  <strong>Mace of Smiting</strong> (rare). You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it's a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.
  <strong>Mace of Terror</strong> (rare). This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Mantle of Spell Resistance</strong> (rare). You have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.
  <strong>Manual of Bodily Health</strong> (very rare). This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
  <strong>Manual of Gainful Exercise</strong> (very rare). This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
  <strong>Manual of Golems</strong> (very rare). This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.  | d20   | Golem | Time     | Cost       | |-------|-------|----------|------------| | 1-5   | Clay  | 30 days  | 65,000 gp  | | 6-17  | Flesh | 60 days  | 50,000 gp  | | 18    | Iron  | 120 days | 100,000 gp | | 19-20 | Stone | 90 days  | 80,000 gp  |  To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.
  <strong>Manual of Quickness of Action</strong> (very rare). This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
  <strong>Marvelous Pigments</strong> (very rare). Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.  Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.
  <strong>Medallion of Thoughts</strong> (uncommon). The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Mirror of Life Trapping</strong> (very rare). When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.  If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.  Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.  An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.  If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.  While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.  In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
  <strong>Mithral Armor</strong> (uncommon). Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
  <strong>Necklace of Adaptation</strong> (uncommon). While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
  <strong>Necklace of Fireballs</strong> (rare). This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
  <strong>Necklace of Prayer Beads</strong> (rare). This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.  | d20   | Bead of...   | Spell                                         | |-------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------| | 1-6   | Blessing     | Bless                                         | | 7-12  | Curing       | Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration | | 13-16 | Favor        | Greater restoration                           | | 17-18 | Smiting      | Branding smite                                | | 19    | Summons      | Planar ally                                   | | 20    | Wind walking | Wind walk                                     |
  <strong>Nine Lives Stealer</strong> (very rare). You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
  <strong>Oathbow</strong> (very rare). When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.  When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.  While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
  <strong>Oil of Etherealness</strong> (rare). Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.
  <strong>Oil of Sharpness</strong> (very rare). This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
  <strong>Oil of Slipperiness</strong> (uncommon). This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.
  <strong>Pearl of Power</strong> (uncommon). While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Periapt of Health</strong> (uncommon). You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.
  <strong>Periapt of Proof against Poison</strong> (rare). This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.
  <strong>Periapt of Wound Closure</strong> (uncommon). While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.
  <strong>Philter of Love</strong> (uncommon). The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
  <strong>Pipes of Haunting</strong> (uncommon). You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
  <strong>Pipes of the Sewers</strong> (uncommon). You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.  The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.
  <strong>Plate Armor of Etherealness</strong> (legendary). While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.
  <strong>Portable Hole</strong> (rare). This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.  Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
  <strong>Potion of Animal Friendship</strong> (uncommon). When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
  <strong>Potion of Clairvoyance</strong> (rare). When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.
  <strong>Potion of Climbing</strong> (common). When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
  <strong>Potion of Diminution</strong> (rare). When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
  <strong>Potion of Flying</strong> (very rare). When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
  <strong>Potion of Gaseous Form</strong> (rare). When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
  <strong>Potion of Giant Strength</strong> (varies). When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.  | Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    | |-------------------|----------|-----------| | Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  | | Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      | | Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      | | Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare | | Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |
  <strong>Potion of Growth</strong> (uncommon). When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
  <strong>Potion of Healing</strong> (varies). You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.  Potions of Healing (table)  | Potion of ...    | Rarity    | HP Regained | |------------------|-----------|-------------| | Healing          | Common    | 2d4 + 2     | | Greater healing  | Uncommon  | 4d4 + 4     | | Superior healing | Rare      | 8d4 + 8     | | Supreme healing  | Very rare | 10d4 + 20   |
  <strong>Potion of Heroism</strong> (rare). For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
  <strong>Potion of Invisibility</strong> (very rare). This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
  <strong>Potion of Mind Reading</strong> (rare). When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13). The potion's dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.
  <strong>Potion of Poison</strong> (uncommon). This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.  If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
  <strong>Potion of Resistance</strong> (uncommon). When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.  | d10 | Damage Type | |-----|-------------| | 1   | Acid        | | 2   | Cold        | | 3   | Fire        | | 4   | Force       | | 5   | Lightning   | | 6   | Necrotic    | | 7   | Poison      | | 8   | Psychic     | | 9   | Radiant     | | 10  | Thunder     |
  <strong>Potion of Speed</strong> (very rare). When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.

  <strong>Restorative Ointment</strong> (uncommon). This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.  As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.
  <strong>Ring of Animal Influence</strong> (rare). This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells:  * Animal friendship (save DC 13) * Fear (save DC 13), targeting only beasts that have an Intelligence of 3 or lower * Speak with animals
  <strong>Ring of Djinni Summoning</strong> (legendary). While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.  While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.  After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.
  <strong>Ring of Elemental Command</strong> (legendary). This ring is linked to one of the four Elemental Planes. The GM chooses or randomly determines the linked plane.  While wearing this ring, you have advantage on attack rolls against elementals from the linked plane, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, you have access to properties based on the linked plane.  The ring has 5 charges. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Spells cast from the ring have a save DC of 17.  Ring of Air Elemental Command. You can expend 2 of the ring's charges to cast dominate monster on an air elemental. In addition, when you fall, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. You can also speak and understand Auran.  If you help slay an air elemental while attuned to the ring, you gain access to the following additional properties:  * You have resistance to lightning damage. * You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. * You can cast the following spells from the ring, expending the necessary number of charges: chain lightning (3 charges), gust of wind (2 charges), or wind wall (1 charge).  Ring of Earth Elemental Command. You can expend 2 of the ring's charges to cast dominate monster on an earth elemental.

Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | | 88-90  | A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand's tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide.

You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | | 96-97  | The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days.

If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic. |
  <strong>Weapon, +1, +2, or +3</strong> (uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)). You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity.
  <strong>Well of Many Worlds</strong> (legendary). This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold and place the well of many worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once well of many worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.
  <strong>Wind Fan</strong> (uncommon). While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the gust of wind spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
  <strong>Winged Boots</strong> (uncommon). While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.
  <strong>Wings of Flying</strong> (rare). While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.     ## Sentient Magic Items  Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.
  <strong>Orb of Dragonkind</strong> (artifact). Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.  As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.  Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.  An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.  While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.  While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.  Random Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:  * 2 minor beneficial properties * 1 minor detrimental property * 1 major detrimental property  Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).  You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.  Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.  Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

  <em>Dark Maw</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 182) – Necromancy Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: 1 round Penumbral ichor drips from your shadow‐stained mouth, filling your mouth with giant shadow fangs. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage as your shadowy fangs sink into it. If you have a bite attack (such as from a racial trait or a spell like alter self), you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage roll but not to your temporary hit points. If you hit a humanoid target, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points until the start of your next turn. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
  <em>Dark Web Of The Spider Monarch</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 182) – 5th-Level Conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (30‐foot cube) Components: V, S, M (a thread of black silk) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour A 30‐foot cube centered on you, fills with sticky, night‐black webbing. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. You are unaffected by the aforementioned effects of the webs and gain a climbing speed of 30 feet when moving on the webs. If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters the webs during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained for as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. Each turn that you are in the webs, you can use a bonus action to siphon life force from every creature restrained by the webs. Each creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, it is no longer restrained. The webs are not flammable, but are susceptible to radiant damage. Any 5‐foot cube of webs exposed to radiant damage dissipates to nothing in 1 round.
  <em>Blade Of Wrath</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 155) – You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.  You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn.  The blade sheds bright light in a 20‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Blazing Chariot</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 155) – Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied 10‐foot‐square space you can see within range. Two horses made of fire and light pull the chariot. You and up to three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement) and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature that touches the chariot or hits it (or a creature riding in it) with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage. The chariot has AC 18 and 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and has resistance to all other nonmagical damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit points, and any creature riding it falls out. The chariot has a speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.  On your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your own movement. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action, you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space. The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot, is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone in that space.
  <em>Angelic Guardian</em> (1st-Level Conjuration <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 145) – You conjure a minor celestial manifestation to protect a creature you can see within range. A faintly glowing image resembling a human head and shoulders hovers within 5 feet of the target for the duration. The manifestation moves to interpose itself between the target and any incoming attacks, granting the target a +2 bonus to AC. Also, the first time the target gets a failure on a Dexterity saving throw while the spell is active, it can use its reaction to reroll the save. The spell then ends.
  <em>Animal Spy</em> (2nd-Level Divination <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 145) – You create a mental link between you and a beast within range. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to transfer your awareness to the beast—using its vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—and another bonus action on any subsequent turn to return your awareness to your body. You can use an action to dismiss the spell entirely. This spell affects normal beasts, including giant versions of animals, but not conjured animals or familiars. The spell does not allow you to control the beast or make it friendly to you. While you experience the world through the beast’s senses, your body is motionless, unaware of the outside world and effectively unconscious. The spell ends if the distance between you and the beast is ever greater than 1 mile, or if the beast is killed. If you are using the beast’s senses when it is killed, you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds from the shock of experiencing its death.
  <em>Animate Ghoul</em> (2nd-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 145) – You raise one Medium or Small humanoid corpse as a ghoul under your control. Any class levels or abilities the creature had in life are gone, replaced by the standard ghoul stat block. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 3rd‐level spell slot, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large ghoul. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, this spell creates a ghast, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.
  <em>Animate Greater Undead</em> (6th-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 145) – Animate greater undead creates an undead servant from a pile of bones or from the corpse of a Large or Huge humanoid within range. The spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead skeleton or zombie. A skeleton uses the stat block of a minotaur skeleton, or a zombie uses the stat block of an ogre zombie, unless a more appropriate stat block is available. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying your commands. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again while you have it controlled. Casting the spell for this purpose reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have previously animated rather than animating a new one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can reanimate one additional creature for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Exsanguinate</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – You cause the body of a creature within range to become engorged with blood or ichor. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage each round, it is incapacitated, and it cannot speak, as it vomits up torrents of blood or ichor. In addition, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success— except for the reduction of its hit point maximum, which lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Exsanguinating Cloud</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – When you cast this spell, a rose‐colored mist billows up in a 20‐foot radius, centered on a point you indicate within range, making the area heavily obscured and draining blood from living creatures in the cloud. The cloud spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses it, ending the spell. This cloud leaches the blood or similar fluid from creatures in the area. It doesn’t affect undead or constructs. Any creature in the cloud when it’s created or at the start of your turn takes 6d6 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion.
  <em>Extract Knowledge</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – By touching a recently deceased corpse, you gain one specific bit of knowledge from it that was known to the creature in life. You must form a question in your mind as part of casting the spell; if the corpse has an answer to your question, it reveals the information to you telepathically. The answer is always brief—no more than a sentence— and very specific to the framed question. It doesn’t matter whether the creature was your friend or enemy; the spell compels it to answer in any case.
  <em>Exude Acid</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – You cause your body to produce a caustic acid. You and anything you were holding or carrying when the spell is cast is immune to the acid. While the spell is active, you can make a melee attack roll against a target, dealing 4d4 acid damage on a hit. If you are grappling a creature, it takes the acid damage every round on your turn, as if you had made a successful attack. If you are grappled by a creature, or restrained or immobilized by physical means (ropes, chains, or similar restraints), the creature or the restraints takes the acid damage each round.
  <em>Fault Line</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – The ground thrusts sharply upward along a 5‐foot‐wide, 60‐foot‐long line that you designate. All spaces affected by the spell become difficult terrain. In addition, all creatures in the affected area are knocked prone and take 8d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures that make a successful Dexterity saving throw take half as much damage and are not knocked prone. This spell doesn’t damage permanent structures.
  <em>Feather Field</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 194) – A magical barrier of chaff in the form of feathers appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC against ranged attacks by magic weapons. At Higher Levels. When you cast feather field using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration is increased by 1 round for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Scaly Hide</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 243) – A creature you touch grows a protective layer of scales that resembles that of a dragon. Until the spell ends,the target’s AC can’t be lower than 16, regardless of the type of armor it is wearing. Additionally, the target gains resistance to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Scentless</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 243) – You touch a willing creature or object that is not being worn or carried. For the duration, the target gives off no odor. A creature that relies on smell has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the target and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target. The target is invisible to a creature that relies solely on smell to sense its surroundings. This spell has no effect on targets with unusually strong scents, such as ghasts.
  <em>Screaming Ray</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 243) – You create a ray of psychic energy to attack your enemies. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is deafened until the end of your next turn. If the target succeeds on a Constitution saving throw, it is not deafened. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 1st. You can direct the rays at one target or several.
  <em>Scribe</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 243) – This spell enables you to create a copy of a one‐page written work by placing a blank piece of paper or parchment near the work that you are copying. All thewriting, illustrations, and other elements in the original are reproduced in the new document, in your handwriting or drawing style. The new medium must be large enough to accommodate the original source. Any magical properties of the original aren’t reproduced, so you can’t use scribe to make copies of spell scrolls or magic books.
  <em>Pitfall</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 233) – A pit opens under a Huge or smaller creature you can see within range that does not have a flying speed. This pit isn’t a simple hole in the floor or ground, but a passage to an extradimensional space. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, which closes over it. At the end of your next turn, a new portal opens 20 feet above where the pit was located, and the creature falls out. It lands prone and takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage. If the original target makes a successful saving throw, you can use a bonus action on your turn to reopen the pit in any location within range that you can see. The spell ends when a creature has fallen through the pit and taken damage, or when the duration expires.
  <em>Poisoned Volley</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 233) – By drawing back and releasing an imaginary bowstring, you summon forth dozens of glowing green arrows. The arrows dissipate when they hit, but all creatures in a 20‐foot square within range take 3d8 poison damage and become poisoned. A creature that makes a successful Constitution saving throw takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Portal Jaunt</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 233) – You touch a specially prepared key to a door or gate, turning it into a one‐way portal to another such door within range. This spell works with any crafted door, doorway, archway, or any other artificial opening, but not natural or accidental openings such as cave entrances or cracks in walls. You must be aware of your destination or be able to see it from where you cast the spell. On completing the spell, the touched door opens, revealing a shimmering image of the location beyond the destination door. You can move through the door, emerging instantly out of the destination door. You can also allow one other willing creature to pass through the portal instead. Anything you carry moves through the door with you, including other creatures, willing or unwilling. For the purpose of this spell, any locks, bars, or magical effects such as arcane lock are ineffectual for the spell’s duration. You can travel only to a side of the door you can see or have physically visited in the past (divinations such as clairvoyance count as seeing). Once you or a willing creature passes through, both doors shut, ending the spell. If you or another creature does not move through the portal within 1 round, the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases by 100 feet and the duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd. Each round added to the duration allows one additional creature to move through the portal before the spell ends.
  <em>Instant Snare</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 217) – You create a snare on a point you can see within range. You can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to find the trap.  When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5 feet above the snare’s location for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a creature, including the restrained target, can use its action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.  This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
  <em>Intensify Light</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 217) – When you are within range of a light source, that source of light sheds bright light and dim light for an additional 10 feet. If the object sheds light from the daylight spell, the light within 10 feet of the object is considered sunlight. If you move out of range of the light source, it immediately reverts to its normal illumination.
  <em>Invested Champion</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 217) – You touch one creature and choose either to become its champion, or for it to become yours. If you choose a creature to become your champion, it fights on your behalf. While this spell is in effect, you can cast any spell with a range of touch on your champion as if the spell had a range of 60 feet. Your champion’s attacks are considered magical, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to encourage your champion, granting it advantage on its next attack roll.  If you become the champion of another creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against creatures that have attacked your charge within the last round. If you are wielding a shield, and a creature within 5 feet of you attacks your charge, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as if you had the Protection fighting style. If you already have the Protection fighting style, then in addition to imposing disadvantage, you can also push an enemy 5 feet in any direction away from your charge when you take your reaction. You can use a bonus action on your turn to reroll the damage for any successful attack against a creature that is threatening your charge.  Whichever version of the spell is cast, if the distance between the champion and its designated ally increases to more than 60 feet, the spell ends.
  <em>Ire Of The Mountain</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 217) – An ire of the mountain spell melts nonmagical objects that are made primarily of metal. Choose one metal object weighing 10 pounds or less that you can see within range. Tendrils of blistering air writhe toward the target. A creature holding or wearing the item must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage and the spell has no further effect. On a failed save, the targeted object melts and is destroyed, and the creature takes 4d8 fire damage if it is wearing the object, or 2d8 fire damage if it is holding the object. If the object is not being held or worn by a creature, it is automatically melted and rendered useless. This spell cannot affect magic items.
  <em>Iron Hand</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 218) – Iron hand is a common spell among metalsmiths and other crafters who work with heat. When you use this spell, one of your arms becomes immune to fire damage, allowing you to grasp red‐hot metal, scoop up molten glass with your fingers, or reach deep into a roaring fire to pick up an object. In addition, if you take the Dodge action while you’re protected by iron hand, you have resistance to fire damage until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Iron Mind</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 218) – One willing creature you touch becomes immune to psychic damage and mind‐altering effects for the spell’s duration.
  <em>Iron Stomach</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 218) – You subtly alter the digestive system of the creature you touch, allowing it to safely eat and extract nutrition from any organic matter it eats. As long as the creature eats at least 1 pound of organic matter per day, it does not suffer from hunger. If it eats organic matter that is poisonous, or that has been poisoned with an organic substance (serpent venom, for example), it has advantage on the saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Kareef's Entreaty</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 218) – Your kind words offer hope and support to a fallen comrade. Choose a willing creature you can see within range that is about to make a death saving throw. The creature gains advantage on the saving throw, and if the result of the saving throw is 18 or higher, the creature regains 3d4 hit points immediately. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the creature adds 1 to its death saving throw for every two slot levels above 1st and regains an additional 1d4 hit points for each slot level above 1st if its saving throw result is 18 or higher.
  <em>Convoluted Dictum</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 177) – You manipulate the thinking of a creature within range, compelling it to take longer, more elaborate means to complete actions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take only one action or bonus action on its turn until the spell ends. If the target tries to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t do so, the spell is wasted. If the target interacts with an object while taking its action, such as drawing a sword as part of an attack, it must also roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, it must make the interaction with the object its sole action on that round, taking the Use An Object action. In the example given, the target would take its action drawing the sword with an extensive amount of flourish or drama and be unable to attack with it until its next turn. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
  <em>Costly Victory</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 177) – You select up to ten enemies you can see that are within range. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature is cursed to burst into flame if it reduces one of your allies to 0 hit points before this spell’s duration expires. The affected creature takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 radiant damage when it bursts into flame. If the affected creature is wearing flammable material (or is made of flammable material, such as a plant creature), it catches on fire and continues burning; the creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.
  <em>Create Ring Servant</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 177) – You touch two metal rings and infuse them with life, creating a short‐lived but sentient construct known as a ring servant (see Creature Codex). The ring servant appears adjacent to you. It reverts form, changing back into the rings used to cast the spell, when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The ring servant is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the ring servant, which acts on its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the ring servant, it defends itself and you from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
  <em>Create Thunderstaff</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 177) – After you cast create thunderstaff on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound. After 60 days, the staff is fully charged and can’t absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a thunderstaff, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a thunderwave spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged. If the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.
  <em>Creeping Ice</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 177) – You create a sheet of ice that covers a 5‐foot square within range and lasts for the spell’s duration. The iced area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area where you cast the spell must make a successful Strength saving throw or be restrained by ice that rapidly encases it. A creature restrained by the ice takes 2d6 cold damage at the start of its turn. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success, but it has disadvantage on this check. The creature can also be freed (and the spell ended) by dealing at least 20 damage to the ice. The restrained creature takes half the damage from any attacks against the ice. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th to 6th level, the area increases to a 10‐foot square, the ice deals 4d6 cold damage, and 40 damage is needed to melt each 5‐foot square. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the area increases to a 20‐foot square, the ice deals 6d6 cold damage, and 60 damage is needed to melt each 5‐foot square.
  <em>Shade</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 247) – You create a magical screen across your eyes. While the screen remains, you are immune to blindness caused by visible effects, such as color spray. The spell doesn’t alleviate blindness that’s already been inflicted on you. If you normally suffer penalties on attacks or ability checks while in sunlight, those penalties don’t apply while you’re under the effect of this spell.
  <em>Shared Sacrifice</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 247) – You and up to five of your allies within range contribute part of your life force to create a pool that can be used for healing. Each target takes 5 necrotic damage (which can’t be reduced but can be healed normally), and those donated hit points are channeled into a reservoir of life essence. As an action, any creature who contributed to the pool of hit points can heal another creature by touching it and drawing hit points from the pool into the injured creature. The injured creature heals a number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and the hit points in the pool decrease by the same amount. This process can be repeated until the pool is exhausted or the spell ends.
  <em>Sheen Of Ice</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 247) – An icy globe shoots from your finger to a point within range and then explodes in a spray of ice. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or become coated in ice for 1 minute. Ice‐coated creatures move at half speed. An invisible creature becomes outlined by the ice so that it loses the benefits of invisibility while the ice remains. The spell ends for a specific creature if that creature takes 5 or more fire damage.
  <em>Shield Of Starlight</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 247) – You wrap yourself in a protective shroud of the night sky made from swirling shadows and punctuated by twinkling motes of light. The shroud grants you resistance against either radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when the spell is cast). You also shed dim light in a 10‐foot radius. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
  <em>Trench</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 267) – By making a scooping gesture, you cause the ground to slowly sink in an area 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, originating from a point within range. When the casting is finished, a 5‐foot‐deep trench is the result. The spell works only on flat, open ground (not on stone or paved surfaces) that is not occupied by creatures or objects.
  <em>Trick Question</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 267) – You pose a question that can be answered by one word, directed at a creature that can hear you. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to answer your question truthfully. When the answer is given, the target knows that you used magic to compel it.
  <em>Blood Scarab</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 159) – Your blood is absorbed into the beetle’s exoskeleton to form a beautiful, rubylike scarab that flies toward a creature of your choice within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
  <em>Blood Spoor</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 159) – By touching a drop of your quarry’s blood (spilled or drawn within the past hour), you can follow the creature’s trail unerringly across any surface or under water, no matter how fast you are moving. If your quarry takes flight, you can follow its trail along the ground—or through the air, if you have the means to fly. If your quarry moves magically (such as by way of a dimension door or a teleport spell), you sense its trail as a straight path leading from where the magical movement started to where it ended. Such a route might lead through lethal or impassable barriers. This spell even reveals the route of a creature using pass without trace, but it fails to locate a creature protected by nondetection or by other effects that prevent scrying spells or cause divination spells to fail. If your quarry moves to another plane, its trail ends without trace, but blood spoor picks up the trail again if the caster moves to the same plane as the quarry before the spell’s duration expires.
  <em>Blood Tide</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 159) – When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes a –2 penalty on the creature’s Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. Blood tide has no effect on undead or constructs. A bleeding creature might attract the attention of creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances. A cure wounds spell stops the bleeding before the duration of blood tide expires, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The spell’s duration increases to 2 minutes when you reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level, and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.
  <em>Blood To Acid</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 159) – You designate a creature within range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood elemental or a blood zombie (see Creature Codex), the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.
  <em>Aspect Of The Serpent</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 150) – A creature you touch takes on snakelike aspects for the duration of the spell. Its tongue becomes long and forked, its canine teeth become fangs with venom sacs, and its pupils become sharply vertical. The target gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet and blindsight with a range of 30 feet. As a bonus action when you cast the spell, the target can make a ranged weapon attack with a normal range of 60 feet that deals 2d6 poison damage on a hit. As an action, the target can make a bite attack using either Strength or Dexterity (Melee Weapon Attack: range 5 ft., one creature; Hit: 2d6 piercing damage), and the creature must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature paralyzed in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success). At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the ranged attack and bite attack damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Aura Of Listlessness</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 150) – You create an aura of power around you that saps the will and determination from creatures, making them unable to act. Any creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take actions, reactions, or bonus actions on its turn, except for the Disengage action. Affected creatures can move, but only to distance themselves from harmful conditions, such as attacks by other creatures or hazardous effects that damage or cause ill effects. A creature that moves out of the area can act normally in the following round. Any creature that remains in the area must make another successful saving throw on its turn or continue to be affected by the spell.
  <em>Aura Of Protection Or Destruction</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 150) – When you cast this spell, you radiate an otherworldly energy that warps the fate of all creatures within 30 feet of you. Decide whether to call upon either a celestial or a fiend for aid. Choosing a celestial charges a 30‐foot‐radius around you with an aura of nonviolence; until the start of your next turn, every attack roll made by or against a creature inside the aura is treated as a natural 1. Choosing a fiend charges the area with an aura of violence; until the start of your next turn, every attack roll made by or against a creature inside the aura, including you, is treated as a natural 20. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can extend the duration by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Aura Of Wrath</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 150) – You surround yourself with a psychic aura that drives creatures within 20 feet of you into a violent frenzy. A creature inside the aura or that enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with rage. A creature overcome with rage must take its next action to attack the nearest possible target —if more than one target is available, choose randomly. The creature uses a melee weapon if it has one; otherwise, it attacks with any other offensive ability it possesses. If an affected creature leaves the aura, the aura’s effect persists for 1 round afterward. A creature affected by the aura makes a new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature makes a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same aura. If a creature affected by your aura hits you with an attack that targets you, the creature takes 4d8 psychic damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that leave the aura remain under the effect of the spell for 1 additional round for each slot level above 6th. Also, the damage an affected creature takes from striking you increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Time Jump</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 263) – You touch a construct and throw it forward in time if it fails a Constitution saving throw. The construct disappears for 1d4 + 1 rounds, during which time it cannot act or be acted upon in any way. When the construct returns, it is unaware that any time has passed.
  <em>Time Loop</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 263) – You capture a creature within range in a loop of time. The target is teleported to the space where it began its most recent turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature must repeat the activities it undertook on its previous turn, following the sequence of moves and actions to the best of its ability. It doesn’t need to move along the same path or attack the same target, but if it moved and then attacked on its previous turn, its only option is to move and then attack on this turn. If the space where the target began its previous turn is occupied or if it’s impossible for the target to take the same action (if it cast a spell but is now unable to do so, for example), the target becomes incapacitated. An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For as long as the spell lasts, the target teleports back to its starting point at the start of each of its turns, and it must repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.
  <em>Time Slippage</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 263) – You ensnare a creature within range in an insidious trap, causing different parts of its body to function at different speeds. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with the same effects for success and failure. In addition, the creature has disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws but advantage on Constitution or Charisma saving throws for the spell’s duration (a side effect of the chronal anomaly suffusing its body). The spell ends if the creature makes three successful saves in a row.
  <em>Time Step</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 263) – You briefly step forward in time. You disappear from your location and reappear at the start of your next turn in a location of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the space you disappeared from. You can’t be affected by anything that happens during the time you’re missing, and you aren’t aware of anything that happens during that time.
  <em>Time Vortex</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 263) – This spell destabilizes the flow of time, enabling you to create a vortex of temporal fluctuations that are visible as a spherical distortion with a 10‐foot radius, centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the time vortex. While the spell lasts, a creature that enters the sphere or starts its turn inside the sphere must also succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected. On a successful save, it becomes immune to this casting of the spell.  An affected creature can’t take reactions and rolls a d10 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn. 1–2 The creature is affected as if by a slow spell until the start of its next turn. 6–8 The creature’s current initiative result is reduced by 5. The creature begins using this new initiative result in the next round. Multiple occurrences of this effect for the same creature are cumulative.  You can move the temporal vortex 10 feet each round as a bonus action. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Flurry</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 198) – A flurry of snow surrounds you and extends to a 5‐foot radius around you. While it lasts, anyone trying to see into, out of, or through the affected area (including you) has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls.
  <em>Fog Of War</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 198) – You cloud the minds of your opponents, hindering their perception of the battlefield and veiling reality with twisted illusions. You can affect up to six creatures within range. While the spell is in effect, targeted creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to locate enemies. If a targeted creature makes an attack against a creature that has at least one other creature adjacent to it—friend or foe—the targeted creature must roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, its attack is applied to the adjacent creature instead (roll randomly to determine the new target if there is more than one adjacent creature) and deals damage as normal if it hits. Each round, a targeted creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is unhindered by the spell for that round.
  <em>Forest Affinity</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 198) – The forest floor swirls and shifts around you, welcoming you into its embrace. While in a forest, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. While hidden in a forest, you have advantage on your next initiative roll. The spell ends if you attack or cast a spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The spell ends if you or any other target of this spell attacks or casts a spell.
  <em>Forest Native</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 198) – While in a forest, you touch a willing creature and infuse it with the forest’s energy, creating a bond between the creature and the environment. For the duration of the spell, as long as the creature remains within the forest, its movement is not hindered by difficult terrain composed of natural vegetation. In addition, the creature has advantage on saving throws against environmental effects such as excessive heat or cold or high altitude.
  <em>Forest Of Spears</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 198) – A forest of stone spears rises up from the ground in a 30‐foot radius around a point you designate within range. Creatures in the area take 5d8 piercing damage and are restrained. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the restrained condition. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the spears takes an extra 2d8 damage from the pain of being held aloft as well as bleeding from its wounds. A creature restrained by the spears can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a successful save, it frees itself. For the duration of the spell, the area is difficult terrain. The spears (AC 14) can be damaged; they are immune to piercing damage and have resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. If a 5‐foot‐square section of spears takes 15 damage, that’s enough to free a restrained creature or clear the section of spears.
  <em>Brawn Boost</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – Transmutation Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Strength check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Breathtaking Wind</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – 1st-Level Evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You target a creature with a blast of wintry air. That creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become unable to speak or cast spells with a vocal component for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Breeze Compass</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – 3rd-Level Divination Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a magnetized needle) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour When you cast breeze compass, you must clearly imagine or mentally describe a location. It doesn’t need to be a location you’ve been to as long as you know it exists on the Material Plane. Within moments, a gentle breeze arises and blows along the most efficient path toward that destination. Only you can sense this breeze, and whenever it brings you to a decision point (a fork in a passageway, for example), you must make a successful DC 8 Intelligence (Arcana) check to deduce which way the breeze indicates you should go. On a failed check, the spell ends. The breeze guides you around cliffs, lava pools, and other natural obstacles, but it doesn’t avoid enemies or hostile creatures.
  <em>Bright Sparks</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – Evocation Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, M (flint and steel) Duration: 1 round Sparks fly from your fingers for a moment, generating bright blue light. This illuminates the region around you to a distance of 60 feet until the start of your next turn. Wisdom (Perception) checks have advantage to spot creatures hidden in shadows.
  <em>Brimstone Infusion</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – Transmutation Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a flask of alchemist’s fire and 5 gp worth of brimstone) Duration: 24 hours You infuse an ordinary flask of alchemist’s fire with magical brimstone. While so enchanted, the alchemist’s fire can be thrown 40 feet instead of 20, and it does 2d6 fire damage instead of 1d4. The Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames uses your spell save DC instead of DC 10. Infused alchemist’s fire returns to its normal properties after 24 hours.
  <em>Brittling</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – 4th-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (an icicle) Duration: Instantaneous This spell uses biting cold to make a metal or stone object you touch become brittle and more easily shattered. The object’s hit points are reduced by a number equal to your level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or break the object are made with advantage if they occur within 1 minute of the spell’s casting. If the object isn’t shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in before the spell was cast.
  <em>Burning Radiance</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 163) – 6th-Level Evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (60‐foot line) Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous A line of light 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d8 radiant damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents a creature from catching fire. The burning radiance ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
  <em>Ice Hammer</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 213) – When you cast ice hammer, a warhammer fashioned from ice appears in your hands. This weapon functions as a standard warhammer in all ways, and it deals an extra 1d10 cold damage on a hit. You can drop the warhammer or give it to another creature. The warhammer melts and is destroyed when it or its user accumulates 20 or more fire damage, or when the spell ends.
  <em>Ice Soldiers</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 213) – You pour water from the vial and cause two ice soldiers to appear within range. The ice soldiers cannot form if there is no space available for them. The soldiers act immediately on your turn. You can mentally command them (no action required by you) to move and act where and how you wish. If you command an ice soldier to attack, it attacks that creature exclusively until the target is dead, at which time the soldier melts into a puddle of water. If an ice soldier moves farther than 30 feet from you, it immediately melts. Ice soldiers have the statistics shown below.
  <em>Fusillade Of Ice</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 202) – You unleash a spray of razor‐sharp ice shards. Each creature in the 30‐foot cone takes 4d6 cold damage and 3d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by your choice of 1d6 cold damage or 1d6 piercing damage for each slot level above 4th. You can make a different choice (cold damage or piercing damage) for each slot level above 4th. Casting this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher increases the range to a 60‐foot cone.
  <em>Gear Barrage G</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 202) – You create a burst of magically propelled gears. Each creature within a 60‐foot cone takes 3d8 slashing damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Constructs have disadvantage on the saving throw.
  <em>Ghoul King's Cloak</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 202) – You touch a creature, giving it some of the power of a ghoul king. The target gains the following benefits for the duration: • Its Armor Class increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. • When it uses the Attack action to make a melee weapon attack or a ranged weapon attack, it can make one additional attack of the same kind. • It is immune to necrotic damage and radiant damage. • It can’t be reduced to less than 1 hit point. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 9th‐ level spell slot, the spell lasts for 10 minutes and doesn’t require concentration.
  <em>Giant's Jest</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg ) – This spell enlarges a weapon or other object that you can see within range, temporarily making it sized for a Gargantuan creature. The object is twelve times heavier than its original weight and in most circumstances cannot be used effectively by Huge or smaller creatures. The object retains its usual qualities (including magical powers and effects) and returns to normal size when the spell ends.
  <em>Comprehend Wild Shape</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 173) – Give one of the carved totems to an ally while keeping the other yourself. For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn’t a telepathic link; you simply understand each other’s verbal communication, similar to the effect of a speak with animals spell. This effect doesn’t allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells.
  <em>Conjure Fey Hound</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 173) – You summon a fey hound to fight by your side. A hound of the night (see Tome of Beasts) appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned hound is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned hound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the hound, it stands by your side and attacks nearby creatures that are hostile to you but otherwise takes no actions.
  <em>Conjure Fiends</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 173) – You summon fiends that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You choose one of the following options for what appears: • One fiend of challenge rating 2 or lower • Two fiends of challenge rating 1 or lower • Four fiends of challenge rating 1/2 or lower • Eight fiends of challenge rating 1/4 or lower A fiend summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.
  <em>Conjure Forest Defender</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 173) – When you cast this spell in a forest, you fasten sticks and twigs around a body. The body comes to life as a forest defender (see below). The forest defender is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the forest defender, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal or mental commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as you remain within its line of sight. If you don’t issue any commands to the forest defender, if you are out of its line of sight, or if you are unconscious, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. A body sacrificed to form the forest defender is permanently destroyed and can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. You can have only one forest defender under your control at a time. If you cast this spell again, the previous forest defender crumbles to dust.
  <em>Conjure Greater Spectral Dead</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 174) – You summon an incorporeal undead creature that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. You choose one of the following options for what appears: One wraith, One spectral guardian (see Tome of Beasts), One swarm of wolf spirits (see Tome of Beasts) Summoned creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creature doesn’t attack you or your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. The creature attacks your enemies and tries to stay within 60 feet of you, but it otherwise controls its own actions. The summoned creature despises being bound and might harm or impede you and your companions by any means at its disposal other than direct attacks if the opportunity arises. At the beginning of the creature’s turn, you can use your reaction to verbally command it. The creature obeys your commands for that turn, and you take 1d6 psychic damage at the end of the turn. If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer command it, it becomes hostile to you and your companions, and it attacks you and your allies if it believes it has a chance to win the fight or to inflict meaningful harm; otherwise it flees. You can’t dismiss the uncontrolled creature, but it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 9th‐level spell slot, you summon a deathwisp (see Tome of Beasts) or two ghosts instead.
  <em>Conjure Mantelet</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 174) – You summon a transparent, faintly luminous barrier with a single arrow slit. The magical mantelet provides you with three‐quarters cover for the duration of the spell. If you move on your turn, the mantelet moves with you.
  <em>Furious Hooves</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 201) – You enhance the feet or hooves of a creature you touch, imbuing it with power and swiftness. The target doubles its walking speed or increases it by 30 feet, whichever addition is smaller. In addition to any attacks the creature can normally make, this spell grants two hoof attacks, each of which deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + plus the target’s Strength modifier (or 1d8 if the target of the spell is Large). For the duration of the spell, the affected creature automatically deals this bludgeoning damage to the target of its successful shove attack.
  <em>Random Damage Type</em> ( <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 201) – 1 Acid 3 Fire 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic 8 Psychic 10 Thunder
  <em>Frostbite</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 201) – Biting cold settles onto a creature you can see. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 cold damage. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the creature’s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it takes another 4d8 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The effect ends when the creature makes its third successful save. Creatures that are immune to cold damage are unaffected by frostbite.
  <em>Frozen Razors</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 201) – Razor‐sharp blades of ice erupt from the ground or other surface, filling a 20‐foot cube centered on a point you can see within range. For the duration, the area is lightly obscured and is difficult terrain. A creature that moves more than 5 feet into or inside the area on a turn takes 2d6 slashing damage
  <em>Hunting Stand</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 212) – You make a camouflaged shelter nestled in the branches of a tree or among a collection of stones. The shelter is a 10‐foot cube centered on a point within range. It can hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. The shelter’s camouflage provides a modicum of concealment to its inhabitants; a creature outside the shelter has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to detect or locate a creature within the shelter.
  <em>Hypnotic Missive</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 212) – You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the words works on the mind of a creature that reads it, convincing the creature that there is some importance to the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance. During combat, a creature so enthralled can take no actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic missive can make a new saving throw against the effects at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation. In nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new saving throw against the effects every hour. Once a creature has made a successful save, it recognizes the magical compulsion that has affected it. This does not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the creature reads the words again, it must make another save or fall under the spell’s effects once more.
  <em>Ice Burn</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 212) – You instill deep cold into the body of a creature within range, damaging it and impairing joints and muscles. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 cold damage and has disadvantage on all Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws until this damage is healed. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature within range for each slot level above 3rd. Each additional target must be within 30 feet of at least one other target.
  <em>Ice Fortress</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 212) – A gleaming fortress of ice springs from a square area of ground that you can see within range. It is a 10‐foot cube (including floor and roof). The fortress can’t overlap any other structures, but any creatures in its space are harmlessly lifted up as the ice rises into position. The walls are made of ice (AC 13), have 120 hit points each, and are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50 percent chance to cause the roof to collapse. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point‐for‐point basis. Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes an ice door with an arcane lock. You designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can enter the fortification. The door has AC 18 and 60 hit points, or it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15 if the arcane lock is dispelled). The fortress catches and reflects light, so that creatures outside the fortress who rely on sight have disadvantage on Perception checks and attack rolls made against those within the fortress if it’s in an area of bright sunlight. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for every slot level above 5th. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Candle's Insight</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 164) – Candle’s insight is cast on its target as the component candle is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully. An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily through even an outrageously false statement, as long as the target believes it’s true. Candle’s insight is used across society: by merchants while negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.
  <em>Carmello-Volta's Irksome Preserves</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 164) – At your command, delicious fruit jam oozes from a small mechanical device (such as a crossbow trigger, a lock, or a clockwork toy), rendering the device inoperable until the spell ends, and the device is cleaned with a damp cloth. Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has no effect until the spell ends. One serving of the jam can be collected in a suitable container. If it’s eaten (as a bonus action) within 24 hours, the jam restores 1d4 hit points. The jam’s flavor is determined by the material component. The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations. First, the target creature negates the effect with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the construct is Tiny, only one component (an eye, a knee, an elbow, and so forth) can be disabled. The affected construct has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that depend on the disabled component until the spell ends and the jam is removed.
  <em>Catapult</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 164) – You magically hurl an object or creature weighing 500 pounds or less 40 feet through the air in a direction of your choosing (including straight up). Objects hurled at specific targets require a spell attack roll to hit. A thrown creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage from the force of the throw, plus any appropriate falling damage, and lands prone. If the target of the spell is thrown against another creature, the total damage is divided evenly between them and both creatures are knocked prone. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10, the distance thrown increases by 10 feet, and the weight thrown increases by 100 pounds for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Calm Of The Storm</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 164) – While visualizing the world as you wish it was, you lay your hands upon a creature other than yourself and undo the effect of a chaos magic surge that affected the creature within the last minute. Reality reshapes itself as if the surge never happened, but only for that creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the time since the chaos magic surge can be 1 minute longer for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Fist Of Iron</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 197) – You transform your hand into iron. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are considered magical.
  <em>Flame Wave</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 197) – A rushing burst of fire rips out from you in a rolling wave, filling a 40‐foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 fire damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you on a failed save; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Flesh To Paper</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 197) – A willing creature you touch becomes as thin as a sheet of paper until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also flattened. The target can’t cast spells or attack, and attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while next to a wall or similar flat surface. The target can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it occupies the same space as an object or a creature when the spell ends, the creature is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was moved. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Flickering Fate</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 197) – You or a creature that you touch can see a few seconds into the future. When the spell is cast, each other creature within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail must declare, in initiative order, what their next action will be. The target of the spell declares his or her action last, after hearing what all other creatures will do. Each creature that declared an action must follow its declaration as closely as possible when its turn comes. For the duration of the spell, the target has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and creatures that declared their actions have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.
  <em>Fluctuating Alignment</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 197) – You channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind. A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends. These changes do not make the affected creature friendly or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to behave in unpredictable ways.
  <em>Aspect Of The Dragon</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 148) – This spell draws out the ancient nature within your blood, allowing you to assume the form of any dragon‐type creature of challenge 10 or less.  You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.  You retain the benefits of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak only if the dragon can normally speak.  When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions normally, but equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form. Any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. The GM has final say on whether the new form can wear or use a particular piece of equipment. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
  <em>Aspect Of The Firebird</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 148) – You take on the aspect of a firebird (see Tome of Beasts), including some physical attributes. A fiery mantle descends upon you, resembling feathery wings and an expansive tail. You gain immunity to fire and a flying speed of 60 feet. Any creatures within 5 feet of you gain immunity to natural, environmental cold.  As an action, you can emit a blast of light 5 feet wide and 50 feet long. All creatures in its path take 6d6 fire damage and are blinded for 1d4 rounds. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. Each time you use this feature of the spell, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. When you expend the last hour of the duration, the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
  <em>Aspect Of The Ram</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 148) – You take on the aspect of a ram, including some physical attributes. Your body hair grows thick and woolly, and a curling pair of horns sprouts from your head. You can make a ram attack with these horns as an action, and you are proficient with this attack. You deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.  If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hit with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.  You ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble, ice sheets, scree, or steep slopes. You also gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made while climbing or jumping, and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made for balance or to stay on your feet.
  <em>Timely Distraction</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 264) – You call forth a swirling, crackling wave of constantly shifting pops, flashes, and swept‐up debris. This chaos can confound one creature. If the target gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, roll a d4 and consult the following table to determine the result. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the spell ends when its duration expires.
  <em>Tireless</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 264) – You grant machinelike stamina to a creature you touch for the duration of the spell. The target requires no food or drink or rest. It can move at three times its normal speed overland and perform three times the usual amount of labor. The target is not protected from fatigue or exhaustion caused by a magical effect.
  <em>Tolling Doom</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 264) – A deep, tolling bell seems to ring from somewhere above and beyond, judging your enemies and foretelling their impending doom. Up to eight creatures that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the result from the attack roll or saving throw. You gain advantage on any attack against a target that has failed its saving throw against this spell. This spell has no effect on a target that has an Intelligence score lower than 3.
  <em>Bloodhound</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – You touch a willing creature to grant it an enhanced sense of smell. For the duration, that creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell and on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you also grant the target blindsight out to a range of 30 feet for the duration.
  <em>Bloodshot</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – You launch a jet of boiling blood from your eyes at a creature within range. You take 1d6 necrotic damage and make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d10 fire damage plus 2d8 psychic damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Bloody Hands</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – You cause the hands (or other appropriate body parts, such as claws or tentacles) of a creature within range to bleed profusely. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 necrotic damage each round and suffer disadvantage on all melee and ranged attack rolls that require the use of its hands for the spell’s duration. Casting any spell that has somatic or material components while under the influence of this spell requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but it is not lost; the casting can be attempted again in the next round.
  <em>Bloody Smite</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – The next time during the spell’s duration that you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, your weapon pulses with a dull red light, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target. Until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage, it bleeds profusely from the mouth, and it can’t speak intelligibly or cast spells that have a verbal component. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or an ally within 5 feet of it uses an action to tend the wound and makes a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC, or if the target receives magical healing, the spell ends.
  <em>Boiling Blood</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – You cause the blood within a creature’s body to boil with supernatural heat. Choose one creature that you can see within range that isn’t a construct or an undead. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes 2d6 fire damage and the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage and is blinded. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the creature takes an additional 2d6 fire damage and remains blinded. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Boiling Oil</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 160) – You conjure a shallow, 15‐foot‐radius pool of boiling oil centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Triumph Of Ice</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 268) – You transform one of the four elements—air, earth, fire, or water—into ice or snow. The affected area is a sphere with a radius of 100 feet, centered on you. The specific effect depends on the element you choose.  Air. Vapor condenses into snowfall. If the effect of a fog cloud spell, a stinking cloud, or similar magic is in the area, this spell negates it. A creature of elemental air within range takes 8d6 cold damage—and, if airborne, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn to avoid being knocked prone (no falling damage).  Earth. Soil freezes into permafrost to a depth of 10 feet. A creature burrowing through the area has its speed halved until the area thaws unless it can burrow through solid rock. A creature of elemental earth within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage.  Fire. Flames or other sources of extreme heat (such as molten lava) on the ground within range transform into shards of ice, and the area they occupy becomes difficult terrain. Each creature in the previously burning area takes 2d6 slashing damage when the spell is cast and 1d6 slashing damage for every 5 feet it moves in the area (unless it is not hindered by icy terrain) until the spell ends; a successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the slashing damage by half. A creature of elemental fire within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage and be stunned for 1d6 rounds.  Water. Open water (a pond, lake, or river) freezes to a depth of 4 feet. A creature on the surface of the water when it freezes must make a successful Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength (Athletics) check. A creature of elemental water within range takes no damage from the spell but is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw, and it treats the affected area as difficult terrain.
  <em>True Light Of Revelation</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 268) – A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright light up to 30 feet away, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that are invisible become visible while they are within 30 feet of you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30 feet of you become feeble and transparent, their illusory nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa. When a creature that has taken a different form— through spells such as polymorph or shapechange, or from inborn abilities, such as a druid’s Wildshape feature— enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be forced to return to its original form. Likewise, a creature attempting to change shape within the bright light must succeed on a Constitution saving throw in order to do so.
  <em>Shifting The Odds</em> (Divination <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 2nd-Level) – By wrapping yourself in strands of chaotic energy, you gain advantage on the next attack roll or ability check that you make. Fate is a cruel mistress, however, and her scales must always be balanced. The second attack roll or ability check (whichever occurs first) that you make after casting shifting the odds is made with disadvantage.
  <em>Shiver</em> (Evocation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg Cantrip) – You fill a humanoid creature with such cold that its teeth begin to chatter and its body shakes uncontrollably. Roll 5d8; the total is the maximum hit points of a creature this spell can affect. The affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it cannot cast a spell or load a missile weapon until the end of your next turn. Once a creature has been affected by this spell, it is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours. The maximum hit points you can affect increases by 4d8 when you reach 5th level (9d8), 11th level (13d8), and 17th level (17d8).
  <em>Shocking Shroud</em> (Evocation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 4th-Level) – Arcs of electricity dance over your body for the duration, granting you resistance to lightning damage. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, arcs of electricity strike your attacker, who takes 2d8 lightning damage.
  <em>Shroud Of Death</em> (Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 4th-Level) – You call up a black veil of necrotic energy that devours the living. You draw on the life energy of all living creatures within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you cast the spell, every living creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes 1 necrotic damage, and all those hit points transfer to you as temporary hit points. The damage and the temporary hit points increase to 2 per creature at the start of your second turn concentrating on the spell, 3 per creature at the start of your third turn, and so on. All living creatures you can see within 30 feet of you at the start of each of your turns are affected. A creature can avoid the effect by moving more than 30 feet away from you or by getting out of your line of sight, but it becomes susceptible again if the necessary conditions are met. The temporary hit points last until the spell ends.
  <em>Sidestep Arrow</em> (Divination <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 3rd-Level) – With a few perfectly timed steps, you interpose a foe between you and danger. You cast this spell when an enemy makes a ranged attack or a ranged spell attack against you but before the attack is resolved. At least one other foe must be within 10 feet of you when you cast sidestep arrow. As part of casting the spell, you can move up to 15 feet to a place where an enemy lies between you and the attacker. If no such location is available, the spell has no effect. You must be able to move (not restrained or grappled or prevented from moving for any other reason), and this move does not provoke opportunity attacks. After you move, the ranged attack is resolved with the intervening foe as the target instead of you.
  <em>Cruor Of Visions</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 178) – You prick your finger with a bone needle as you cast this spell, taking 1 necrotic damage. This drop of blood must be caught in a container, such as a platter or a bowl, where it grows into a pool 1 foot in diameter. This pool acts as a crystal ball for the purpose of scrying. If you place a drop (or dried flakes) of another creature’s blood in the container, the creature has disadvantage on any Wisdom saving throw to resist scrying. Additionally, you can treat the pool of blood as a crystal ball of telepathy.
  <em>Crushing Trample</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 178) – Upon casting this spell, you are filled with a desire to overrun your foes. You immediately move up to twice your speed in a straight line, trampling every foe in your path that is of your size category or smaller. If you try to move through the space of an enemy whose size is larger than yours, your movement (and the spell) ends. Each enemy whose space you move through must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. If you have hooves, add your Strength modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage. You move through the spaces of foes whether or not they succeed on their Strength saving throws. You do not provoke opportunity attacks while moving under the effect of crushing trample.
  <em>Crystal Confinement</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 178) – You attempt to preserve a number of creatures in a shell of ice. When you first cast this spell, you can choose up to 20 creatures that you can see: Medium targets count as two creatures, Large targets count as four creatures, Huge targets count as eight creatures, and Gargantuan targets count as 20 creatures. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw or choose to automatically fail the save. On a successful save, nothing happens to the target this round, but it must repeat the save at the start of your next turn—provided you maintain concentration on the spell. On a failed save, a creature is coated in a creeping rime of ice and is restrained. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified as it becomes encased in ice. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the restrained effect on a success. A creature petrified by this spell remains petrified until you either die or choose to end the effect. No other magic can free it. When a creature becomes petrified, you can choose for it to remain aware of its surroundings, though its senses are limited to what it could perceive while motionless and through a thick coating of clear ice. While coated in ice, the creature is immune to all damage and to the effects of aging.
  <em>Kavelin's Instant Aerosol</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 219) – You light a candle and place it beneath an open potion as you cast this spell. The potion is vaporized into a cloud that extends five feet from you in all directions. All creatures in range, including yourself, that breathe the magical vapors can benefit from the effects of the potion. The duration is divided equally among those partaking, rounding down any fractions. If the spell is used with a potion of healing, all creatures in the area receive the average number of hit points that would be healed by a potion of that type.
  <em>Keening Wail</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 219) – You emit an unholy shriek from beyond the grave. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature with 50 hit points or fewer fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is instead reduced to 0 hit points. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Killing Fields</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 219) – You invoke primal spirits of nature to transform natural terrain in a 100‐foot cube in range into a private hunting preserve. The area can’t include manufactured structures and if such a structure exists in the area, the spell ends. While you are conscious and within the area, you are aware of the presence and direction, though not exact location, of each beast and monstrosity with an Intelligence of 3 or lower in the area. When a beast or monstrosity with an Intelligence of 3 or lower tries to leave the area, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is disoriented, uncertain of its surroundings or direction, and remains within the area for 1 hour. On a success, it leaves the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are helped by the area’s effects. All other creatures in the area are hindered by the area’s effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, gives the speaker the benefits of being helped by the area’s effects. Killing fields creates the following effects within the area. Pack Hunters. A helped creature has advantage on attack rolls against a hindered creature if at least one helped ally is within 5 feet of the hindered creature and the helped ally isn’t incapacitated. Slaying. Once per turn, when a helped creature hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by its weapon to a hindered creature. Tracking. A helped creature has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks against a hindered creature. You can create a permanent killing field by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. Structures built in the area after the killing field is permanent don’t end the spell.
  <em>Kiss Of The Succubus</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 219) – You kiss a willing creature or one you have charmed or held spellbound through spells or abilities such as dominate person. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken; this reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Kobold's Fury</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 219) – Your touch infuses the rage of a threatened kobold into the target. The target has advantage on melee weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. In addition, its next successful melee weapon attack against a creature larger than itself does an additional 2d8 damage.
  <em>Potency Of The Pack</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 234) – You bestow lupine traits on a group of living creatures that you designate within range. Choose one of the following benefits to be gained by all targets for the duration: • Thick Fur. Each target sprouts fur over its entire body, giving it a +2 bonus to Armor Class. • Keen Hearing and Smell. Each target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. • Pack Tactics. Each affected creature has advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the attacker’s allies (also under the effect of this spell) is within 5 feet of the target of the attack and the ally isn’t incapacitated. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Power Word Kneel</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 234) – When you shout this word of power, creatures within 20 feet of a point you specify are compelled to kneel down facing you. A kneeling creature is treated as prone. Up to 55 hit points of creatures are affected, beginning with those that have the fewest hit points. A kneeling creature makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends immediately on any creature that takes damage while kneeling.
  <em>Power Word Pain</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 234) – When you utter this word of power, one creature within 60 feet of you takes 4d10 force damage. At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take an extra 4d10 force damage. The effect ends on a successful save.
  <em>Primal Infusion</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 234) – You channel the fury of nature, drawing on its power. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits: • You gain 30 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost. • You have advantage on attack rolls when one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated. • Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon on a hit. • You gain a +2 bonus to AC. • You have proficiency on Constitution saving throws.
  <em>Prismatic Ray</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 234) – A ray of shifting color springs from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a single creature you can see within range. The ray’s effect and the saving throw that applies to it depend on which color is dominant when the beam strikes its target, determined by rolling a d8. d8 Color Effect Saving Throw 1 Red 8d10 fire damage Dexterity 2 Orange 8d10 acid damage Dexterity 3 Yellow 8d10 lightning damage Dexterity 4 Green Target poisoned Constitution 5 Blue Target deafened Constitution 6 Indigo Target frightened Wisdom 7 Violet Target stunned Constitution 8 Shifting ray Target blinded Constitution A target takes half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. A successful Constitution or Wisdom saving throw negates the effect of a ray that inflicts a condition on the target; on a failed save, the target is affected for 5 rounds or until the effect is negated. If the result of your attack roll is a critical hit, you can choose the color of the beam that hits the target, but the attack does not deal additional damage.
  <em>Insightful Maneuver</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 216) – With a flash of insight, you know how to take advantage of your foe’s vulnerabilities. Until the end of your turn, the target has vulnerability to one type of damage (your choice). Additionally, if the target has any other vulnerabilities, you learn them.
  <em>Inspiring Speech</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 216) – The verbal component of this spell is a 10‐minute‐long, rousing speech. At the end of the speech, all your allies within the affected area who heard the speech gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and advantage on saving throws for 1 hour against effects that cause the charmed or frightened condition. Additionally, each recipient gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If you move farther than 1 mile from your allies or you die, this spell ends. A character can be affected by only one casting of this spell at a time; subsequent, overlapping castings have no additional effect and don’t extend the spell’s duration.
  <em>Instant Fortification</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 216) – Through this spell, you transform a miniature statuette of a keep into an actual fort. The fortification springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It is a 10‐foot cube (including floor and roof). Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes a metal door with an arcane lock effect on it. You designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can ignore the lock and enter the fortification. The door has AC 20 and 60 hit points, and it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The walls are made of stone (AC 15) and are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Each 5‐foot‐square section of wall has 90 hit points. Reducing a section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it, allowing access to the inside of the fortification.
  <em>Instant Siege Weapon</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 216) – With this spell, you instantly transform raw materials into a siege engine of Large size or smaller (the GM has information on this topic). The raw materials for the spell don’t need to be the actual components a siege weapon is normally built from; they just need to be manufactured goods made of the appropriate substances (typically including some form of finished wood and a few bits of worked metal) and have a gold piece value of no less than the weapon’s hit points. For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege weapon will fashion any collection of raw materials worth at least 100 gp into a mangonel. Those materials might be lumber and fittings salvaged from a small house, or 100 gp worth of finished goods such as three wagons or two heavy crossbows. The spell also creates enough ammunition for ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition.
  <em>Scry Ambush</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 244) – You foresee your foe’s strike a split second before it occurs. When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat. If you would be surprised, you must make a check using your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can’t use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.
  <em>Sculpt Snow</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 244) – When targeting an area filled with snow, you can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptures bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isn’t strong enough to fool anyone, but the creature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable as a typical snowman. Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with animate objects or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals 2d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 + 1 cold damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.
  <em>Seal Of Sanctuary</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 244) – You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 50 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage. Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are within 50 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 2d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn. Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 50 feet of the seal. The seal has AC 18, 50 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if the seal is reduced to 0 hit points.
  <em>Entropic Damage Field</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 193) – By twisting a length of silver wire around your finger, you tie your fate to those around you. When you take damage, that damage is divided equally between you and all creatures in range who get a failure on a Charisma saving throw. Any leftover damage that can't be divided equally is taken by you. Creatures that approach to within 60 feet of you after the spell was cast are also affected. A creature is allowed a new saving throw against this spell each time you take damage, and a successful save ends the spell's effect on that creature.
  <em>Enumerate</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 193) – You are able to divine the exact amount of a number of like objects in a 10‐foot‐cube centered on a point within range. You can be general ('How many coins in this chest?') or specific ('How many silver coins in this chest?') but can receive only one number as a response from the casting of this spell. If, for example, you want to know the number of coins of each denomination in a chest, you must cast the spell anew for each type of coin to be counted (copper, silver, gold, and so forth).
  <em>Essence Instability</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 193) – You cause the target to radiate a harmful aura. Both the target and every creature beginning or ending its turn within 20 feet of the target suffer 2d6 poison damage per round. The target can make a Constitution saving throw each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Success means the target no longer takes damage from the aura, but the aura still persists around the target for the full duration. Creatures affected by the aura must make a successful Constitution saving throw each round to negate the damage. The aura moves with the original target and is unaffected by gust of wind and similar spells. The aura does not detect as magical or poison, and is invisible, odorless, and intangible (though the spell's presence can be detected on the original target). Protection from poison negates the spell's effects on targets but will not dispel the aura. A foot of metal or stone, two inches of lead, or a force effect such as mage armor or wall of force will block it. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the aura lasts 1 minute longer, and the poison damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Evercold</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 193) – You target a creature within the spell's range, and that creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage. In addition, the target is cursed to feel as if it's exposed to extreme cold. For the duration of evercold, the target must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The target has advantage on the hourly saving throws if wearing suitable cold‐weather clothing, but it has disadvantage on saving throws against other spells and magic that deal cold damage (regardless of its clothing) for the spell's duration. The spell can be ended by its caster or by dispel magic or remove curse.
  <em>Exceptional Wit</em> (Transmutation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 193) – You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Intelligence check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Analyze Device</em> (1st-Level Divination <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 144) – You discover all mechanical properties, mechanisms, and functions of a single construct or clockwork device, including how to activate or deactivate those functions, if appropriate.
  <em>Ancestor's Strength</em> (1st-Level Transmutation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 144) – Choose a willing creature you can see and touch. Its muscles bulge and become invigorated. For the duration, the target is considered one size category larger for determining its carrying capacity, the maximum weight it can lift, push, or pull, and its ability to break objects. It also has advantage on Strength checks.
  <em>Anchoring Rope</em> (1st-Level Evocation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 144) – You create a spectral lanyard. One end is tied around your waist, and the other end is magically anchored in the air at a point you select within range. You can choose to make the rope from 5 to 30 feet long, and it can support up to 800 pounds. The point where the end of the rope is anchored in midair can’t be moved after the spell is cast. If this spell is cast as a reaction while you are falling, you stop at a point of your choosing in midair and take no falling damage. You can dismiss the rope as a bonus action. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional rope for every two slot levels above 1st. Each rope must be attached to a different creature.
  <em>Ancient Shade</em> (5th-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 144) – You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a pile of bones (or even bone dust) of your choice within range, allowing the ancient spirit to answer the questions you pose. These remains can be the remnants of undead, including animated but unintelligent undead, such as skeletons and zombies. (Intelligent undead are not affected.) Though it can have died centuries ago, the older the spirit called, the less it remembers of its mortal life.  Until the spell ends, you can ask the ancient spirit up to five questions if it died within the past year, four questions if it died within ten years, three within one hundred years, two within one thousand years, and but a single question for spirits more than one thousand years dead. The ancient shade knows only what it knew in life, including languages. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it, or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.
  <em>Bleating Call</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 156) – You create a sound on a point within range. The sound’s volume can range from a whisper to a scream, and it can be any sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.  Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the sound and can hear it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must take the Dash or Disengage action and move toward the sound by the safest available route on each of its turns. When it arrives at the source of the sound, the target must use its action to examine the sound. Once it has examined the sound, the target determines the sound is illusory and can no longer hear it, ending the spell’s effects on that target and preventing the target from being affected by the sound again for the duration of the spell. If a target takes damage from you or a creature friendly to you, it is no longer under the effects of this spell.  Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.
  <em>Bleed</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 156) – Crackling energy coats the blade of one weapon you are carrying that deals slashing damage. Until the spell ends, when you hit a creature with the weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers a bleeding wound. Each time you hit a creature with this weapon while it suffers from a bleeding wound, your weapon deals an extra 1 necrotic damage for each time you have previously hit the creature with this weapon (to a maximum of 10 necrotic damage).  Any creature can take an action to stanch the bleeding wound by succeeding on a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
  <em>Bless The Dead</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 156) – You grant a blessing to one deceased creature, enabling it to cross over to the realm of the dead in peace. A creature that benefits from bless the dead can’t become undead. The spell has no effect on living creatures or the undead.
  <em>Blessed Halo</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 156) – A nimbus of golden light surrounds your head for the duration. The halo sheds bright light in a 20‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.  This spell grants you a pool of 10 points of healing. When you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns during the spell’s duration, you can expend points from this pool to restore an equal number of hit points to one creature within 20 feet that you can see.  Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against good creatures within 20 feet.  If any of the light created by this spell overlaps an area of magical darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s pool of healing points increases by 5 for each spell slot above 2nd, and the spell dispels magical darkness created by a spell of a level equal to the slot used to cast this spell.
  <em>Blessed Rest</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 156) – You place a benediction upon a creature, ensuring it a healthy rest. If the target takes a short rest, it can reroll any Hit Die spent for regaining hit points and take the higher roll.  If the target takes a long rest, it regains up to two extra Hit Dice when resting, up to its maximum Hit Dice. For example, if the target has eight Hit Dice, it can regain six spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.  Once the target has taken one rest (long or short), the spell ends.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for every two slot levels above 2nd.
  <em>Cursed Gift</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 181) – Cursed gift imbues an object with a harmful magical effect that you or another creature in physical contact with you is currently suffering from. If you give this object to a creature that freely accepts it during the duration of the spell, the recipient must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the harmful effect is transferred to the recipient for the duration of the spell (or until the effect ends). Returning the object to you, destroying it, or giving it to someone else has no effect. Remove curse and comparable magic can relieve the individual who received the item, but the harmful effect still returns to the previous victim when this spell ends if the effect’s duration has not expired.
  <em>Cynophobia</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 181) – Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or develop an overriding fear of canids, such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and worgs. For the duration, the first time the target sees a canid, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of that canid until the end of its next turn. Each time the target sees a different canid, it must make the saving throw. In addition, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while a canid is within 10 feet of it.
  <em>Daggerhawk</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 181) – When daggerhawk is cast on a nonmagical dagger, a ghostly hawk appears around the weapon. The hawk and dagger fly into the air and make a melee attack against one creature you select within 60 feet, using your spell attack modifier and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier on a hit. On your subsequent turns, you can use an action to cause the daggerhawk to attack the same target. The daggerhawk has AC 14 and, although it’s invulnerable to all damage, a successful attack against it that deals bludgeoning, force, or slashing damage sends the daggerhawk tumbling, so it can’t attack again until after your next turn.
  <em>Dark Heraldry</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 181) – Dark entities herald your entry into combat, instilling a dread in your enemies. Designate a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one) that you can see within range and that have an alignment different from yours. Each of those creatures takes 5d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you; a creature that makes a successful Wisdom saving throw takes half as much damage and is not frightened. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if you can see it.
  <em>Dark Lord's Mantle</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 181) – You infuse yourself with fiendish power, which inspires your allies and intimidates your foes. While the spell lasts,  you exude confidence. You gain advantage on saving throws against all enchantment spells and effects. In addition, each ally within 30 feet of you can roll a d4 once per round and add the result to an attack roll as a bonus action, or to a saving throw as a reaction. An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of you, or that moves within 30 feet of you on its turn, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. If a creature moves out of the spell’s radius, it remains frightened until the start of its next turn, and then the spell ends for that creature. While frightened in this way, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened, and it cannot be affected again by your casting of this spell for 24 hours.
  <em>Drain Item</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 188) – You touch a magic item and cause its magical energies to drain away. If the item is currently carried or held by another creature, you must make a melee spell attack to touch the item, against the wielder’s AC. On a hit, the item loses 1d3 charges. If this reduction drops the item’s charges to 0, any effects that occur when the item loses all its charges immediately take effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you     can drain more charges from an item: 1d4 for     a 5th‐level slot, 1d6 for a 6th‐level slot, 1d8 for a 7th‐level slot, or 2d6 for an 8th‐ or 9th‐level slot.
  <em>Dread Wings</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 188) – A swarm of flying, bat‐like shapes swirl into existence in a 20‐foot‐radius cloud around the point you target your spell. Each round a creature begins its turn in the swarm, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that are immune to necrotic damage are not susceptible to the frightened effect. You can use an action on your turn to move the swarm up to 40 feet in any direction.
  <em>Drown</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 188) – You cause a creature’s lungs to fill with seawater. Unless the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it immediately begins suffocating. A suffocating creature can’t speak or perform verbal spell components. It can hold its breath, and thereafter can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected, as are creatures that can breathe water or that don’t require air. A suffocating (not dying) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Dryad's Kiss</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 188) – You perform an ancient incantation that summons flora from the fey realm. A creature you can see within range is covered with small, purple buds and takes 3d8 necrotic damage; a successful Wisdom saving throw negates the damage but doesn’t prevent the plant growth. The buds can be removed by the target or an ally of the target within 5 feet who uses an action to make a successful Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC, or by a greater restoration or blight spell. While the buds remain, whenever the target takes damage from a source other than this spell, one bud blossoms into a purple and yellow flower that deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. Once four blossoms have formed in this way, the buds can no longer be removed by nonmagical means. The buds and blossoms wilt and fall away when the spell ends, provided the creature is still alive. If a creature affected by this spell dies, sweet‐smelling blossoms quickly cover its body. The flowers wilt and die after one month. At Higher Levels. If this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of targets increases by one for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Waft</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 273) – You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 round. At the start of your next turn, you float rapidly down and land gently on a solid surface beneath you.
  <em>Walk The Twisted Path</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 273) – You and up to five creatures you can see within 20 feet of you enter a shifting landscape of endless walls and corridors. You can find your way to a destination within 100 miles, as long as you know for certain that your destination exists. You must make a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. On a failed check, you don’t find your path this round, and you and your companions each take 4d6 psychic damage. You must repeat the check at the start of each of your turns until you find your way to your destination or until you die. When the spell ends, you and those traveling with you appear in a safe location at your destination.
  <em>Walking Wall</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 273) – This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from miniature axes you provide. The wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet long. It has a base speed of 50 feet and can make up to four attacks per round, using your spell attack modifier. Each successful attack deals 4d6 slashing damage, and the damage is considered magical. The wall has AC 12, 200 hit points, and is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. When reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell’s duration ends, the wall disappears.
  <em>Wall Of Time</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 273) – You create a wall of shimmering, transparent blocks on a solid surface within range. You can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20 feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect. Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial saving throw against a slow spell.
  <em>Warning Shout</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 273) – You sense danger before it happens and call out a warning to an ally. One creature you can see and that can hear you gains advantage on its initiative roll.
  <em>Summon Avatar</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 257) – You summon a worldly incarnation of a Great Old One, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. This avatar manifests as an emanation of elder darkness, augmented by boons from the Void. Choose one of the following options for the type of avatar that appears. (Other options might be available if the GM allows.) An asterisk indicates a spell described in this section: • Avatar of Cthulhu. The incarnation is a deep one (see Tome of Beasts) that can innately cast command and sleep of the deep* at will. • Avatar of Nyarlathotep. The incarnation is a dark voice (see Creature Codex) that can innately cast bane and semblance of dread* at will. • Avatar of Shub-Niggurath. The incarnation is a goat‐man (see Tome of Beasts) that can innately cast Black Goat’s blessing* and unseen strangler* at will. • Avatar of Yog-Sothoth. The incarnation is a human with 1d4 + 1 flesh warps that can innately cast gift of resilience* (see page 71) and thunderwave at will. When the avatar appears, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the avatar is friendly to you and your allies. On a failed save, the avatar is friendly to no one and attacks the nearest creature, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible. Roll initiative for the avatar, which takes its own turns. If it is friendly to you, it obeys verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If the avatar has no command, it attacks the nearest creature. Each round when you maintain concentration on the spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short‐term madness. The same penalty recurs when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating before 1 hour has elapsed, it becomes uncontrolled and hostile until it disappears 1d6 rounds later or until it is killed.
  <em>Summon Eldritch Servitor</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 257) – You summon eldritch aberrations that appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears: • Two ghasts of Leng (see Creature Codex) • One shantak (see Creature Codex) When the summoned creatures appear, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creatures are friendly to you and your allies. On a failure, the creatures are friendly to no one and attack the nearest creatures, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures, which take their own turns as a group. If friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you to issue a command), or they attack the nearest living creature if they are not commanded otherwise. Each round when you maintain concentration on the spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d4 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short‐term madness. The same penalty applies when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long. A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating on the spell before 1 hour has elapsed, the creatures become uncontrolled and hostile until they disappear 1d6 rounds later or until they are killed. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th‐ or 8th‐level spell slot, you can summon four ghasts of Leng or a hound of Tindalos (see Creature Codex). When you cast it with a 9th‐level spell slot, you can summon five ghasts of Leng or a nightgaunt (see Creature Codex).
  <em>Summon Star</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 257) – You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer charmed and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a deva. It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
  <em>Catch The Breath</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 165) – You can cast this spell as a reaction when you’re targeted by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even if a successful save normally only halves the damage.  Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.
  <em>Caustic Blood</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 165) – Your blood becomes caustic when exposed to the air. When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to select up to three creatures within 30 feet of you. Each target takes 1d10 acid damage unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
  <em>Caustic Torrent</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 165) – A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that’s in the line or within 5 feet of it is poisoned for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that don’t breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Caustic Touch</em> (cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 165) – Your hand sweats profusely and becomes coated in a film of caustic slime. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you touch. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 acid damage. If the target was concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
  <em>Cave Dragon's Dominance</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 165) – You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of the cave dragon, growing protective scales and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be lower than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing.  You gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. You can take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws, dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You have resistance to poison damage. Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20‐foot cone of poison gas, dealing 6d8 poison damage to each creature in the cone and making it poisoned until it finishes a long or short rest. A creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon and is not poisoned. Finally, you gain a climbing speed of 40 feet.
  <em>Holy Vow</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You willingly take a vow to complete a task or carry out a service. This task or service cannot conflict with your alignment or your sacred oath. While you serve under the vow, for as long as the spell lasts, your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 10. Whenever you make an attack roll or a saving throw, roll a d4 and add the result to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits apply only when you are involved in activities that directly relate to your avowed task, or to situations you encounter that interfere with your ability to carry out that task (such as random encounters while traveling). If you willingly forsake your vow, the spell ends, and you take 4d10 psychic damage. At the GM’s discretion, you might suffer other penalties and need to atone for your decision. See the “Breaking Your Oath” sidebar in the paladin class description for more details. Failing to complete the task does not incur any penalties as long as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise, leads you to forsake your vow (being charmed, for instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if you do not break the vow).
  <em>Holy Warding</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You make a protective gesture toward your allies. Choose three creatures that you can see within range. Until the end of your next turn, the allies you have chosen have resistance to normal weapon attacks, including bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If a target moves farther than 30 feet from you, the effect ends for that creature.
  <em>Hone Blade</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You magically sharpen the edge of any bladed weapon or object you are touching. The target weapon gets a +1 bonus to damage on its next successful hit.
  <em>Hunger Of Leng</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You curse a creature that you can see in range with an insatiable, ghoulish appetite. If it has a digestive system, the creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to consume the flesh of living creatures for the duration. The target gains a bite attack and moves to and attacks the closest creature that isn’t an undead or a construct. The target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4. If the target is larger than Medium, its damage die increases by 1d4 for each size category it is above Medium. In addition, the target has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all of its hit points. If there isn’t a viable creature within range for the target to attack, it deals piercing damage to itself equal to 2d4 + its Strength modifier. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target has two consecutive failures, hunger of Leng lasts its full duration with no further saving throws allowed.
  <em>Hunter's Cunning</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You grant a creature you touch preternatural senses and insight into its immediate environment. Until the spell ends, the target gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks and ignores the effect of natural (nonmagical) difficult terrain.
  <em>Hunter's Endurance</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 211) – You call on the land to sustain you as you hunt your quarry. Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. If you aren’t familiar with the target creature, you must use a fingernail, lock of hair, bit of fur, or drop of blood  from it as a material component to target that creature with this spell. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to find and track the target, and you must actively pursue the target as if under a geas. In addition, you don’t suffer from exhaustion levels you gain from pursuing your quarry, such as from lack of rest or environmental hazards between you and the target, while the spell is active. When the spell ends, you suffer from all levels of exhaustion that were suspended by the spell. The spell ends only after 24 hours, when the target is dead, when the target is on a different plane, or when the target is restrained in your line of sight.
  <em>Gliding Step</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 204) – Provided you’re not carrying more of a load than your carrying capacity permits, you can walk on the surface of snow rather than wading through it, and you ignore its effect on movement. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin it is, and you can travel on ice as if you were wearing ice skates. You still leave tracks normally while under these effects.
  <em>Gloomwrought Barrier</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 204) – When you cast this spell, you erect a barrier of energy drawn from the realm of death and shadow. This barrier is a wall 20 feet high and 60 feet long, or a ring 20 feet high and 20 feet in diameter. The wall is transparent when viewed from one side of your choice and translucent—lightly obscuring the area beyond it—from the other. A creature that tries to move through the wall must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or stop in front of the wall and become frightened until the start of the creature’s next turn, when it can try again to move through. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against the wall, it is immune to the effect of this barrier.
  <em>Gluey Globule</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 204) – You make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the attack hits, the target creature is restrained. A restrained creature can break free by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. When the creature breaks free, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the glue tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical hit or exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more, the Strength saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also be freed by an application of universal solvent or by taking 20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature breaks free or at the end of 1 minute. Alternatively, gluey globule can also be used to glue an object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case, the spell works like a single application of sovereign glue and lasts for 1 hour.
  <em>Glyph Of Shifting</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 204) – You create a hidden glyph by tracing it on a surface or object that you touch. When you cast the spell, you can also choose a location that’s known to you, within 5 miles, and on the same plane of existence, to serve as the destination for the glyph’s shifting effect. The glyph is triggered when it’s touched by a creature that’s not aware of its presence. The triggering creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to the glyph’s destination. If no destination was set, the creature takes 4d4 force damage and is knocked prone. The glyph disappears after being triggered or when the spell’s duration expires.
  <em>Goat's Hoof Charm</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 204) – A creature you touch traverses craggy slopes with the surefootedness of a mountain goat. When ascending a slope that would normally be difficult terrain for it, the target can move at its full speed instead. The target also gains a +2 bonus on Dexterity checks and saving throws to prevent falling, to catch a ledge or otherwise stop a fall, or to move along a narrow ledge.
  <em>Cloak Of Serpents</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 171) – A mass of writhing, translucent snakes drapes your body, protecting you from harm and fending off enemies. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. For the duration of the spell, you gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, that creature is struck by one of the serpents. The attacker takes 2d8 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the poisoned effect.
  <em>Clockwork Bodyguard</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 171) – You summon clockwork minions to fight for you. Choose one of the following options for what appears (see Tome of Beasts): • One clockwork huntsman • Two clockwork hounds • Four clockwork watchmen The clockwork creatures are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creatures, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue commands, the clockwork creatures defend themselves or you from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The clockwork creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher‐level spell slots, more creatures of your choice appear: twice as many with a 6th‐level slot, three times as many with a 7th‐level slot, and four times as many with an 8th‐level slot.
  <em>Clockwork Bolt</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 171) – You imbue an arrow or crossbow bolt with clockwork magic just as you fire it at your target; spinning blades materialize on the missile after it strikes to further mutilate your enemy. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with a bow or a crossbow against one creature within range. If the attack hits, the missile embeds in the target. Unless the target (or an ally of it within 5 feet) uses an action to remove the projectile (which deals no additional damage), the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage at the end of its next turn from spinning blades that briefly sprout from the missile’s shaft. Afterward, the projectile reverts to normal. This spell deals more damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d8 slashing damage to the target, and the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage (2d8 total) if the embedded ammunition isn’t removed. Both damage amounts increase by 1d8 again at 11th level and at 17th level.
  <em>Closing In</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 171) – Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes with disadvantage if it’s in an enclosed space. On a failed save, the creature believes the world around it is closing in and threatening to crush it. Even in open or clear terrain, the creature feels as though it is sinking into a pit, or that the land is rising around it. The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration, and it takes 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Deep Breath</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 184) – The recipient of this spell can breathe and function normally in thin atmosphere, suffering no ill effect at altitudes of up to 20,000 feet. If more than one creature is touched during the casting, the duration is divided evenly among all creatures touched.
  <em>Deep Focus</em> (3rd-Level (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 184) – You tap into ambient magical energy to stabilize and maintain a spell. The next spell you cast that normally requires concentration will last its full normal duration without the need for concentration, as long as it is cast within 1 minute of your casting of this spell, and the spell to be affected is of 4th level or lower. At the end of the duration, or if 1 minute goes by without your casting a spell that requires concentration, the spell ends.
  <em>Deep Freeze</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 184) – You send a blast of deep cold at a creature, dealing 4d8 cold damage to it and encasing it in ice. An encased creature is grappled and takes an extra 2d8 cold damage at the start of its turn every round it remains encased. If the target of this spell makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it takes half the damage and none of the extra damage and is not encased in ice, but the ice that clings to its body reduces its speed by 15 feet (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) until it takes an action to remove the ice. A grappled target can take an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, breaking free of the ice on a success. Alternatively, another creature within 5 feet of the target can make a Strength check on its turn, freeing the creature on a success. The ice can also be attacked. It has AC 12, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.
  <em>Defensive Quills</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 184) – Sharp quills grow from your skin. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for the duration. If a creature hits you with an attack made by a light weapon, a natural attack, or an unarmed strike, it takes 2d8 piercing damage from your quills. A creature that grapples you takes damage from the quills at the beginning of each of its turns in which it is grappling you. If a creature swallows you, it takes damage from the quills each round at the start of your turn.
  <em>Delay Potion</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 184) – Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. You must consume the potion within 1 round of casting delay potion; otherwise, the spell has no effect. At any point during delay potion’s duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated, it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is delayed, it has no effect at all, and you can consume and benefit from other potions normally. You can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal effect when you drink it.
  <em>Benediction</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 153) – You call down a blessing in the name of an angel of protection. A creature you can see within range shimmers with a faint white light. The next time the creature takes damage, it rolls a d4 and reduces the damage by the result. The spell then ends.
  <em>Bestial Fury</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 153) – You instill primal fury into a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failure, the target must use its action to attack its nearest enemy it can see with unarmed strikes or natural weapons. For the duration, the target’s attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by its weapon, and the target can’t be charmed or frightened. If there are no enemies within reach, the target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
  <em>Bewilderment</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 153) – You temporarily inhibit the cognitive ability of a creature within range. If the target makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes an Intelligence check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Binding Oath</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 153) – You seal an agreement between two or more willing creatures with an oath in the name of the god of justice, using ceremonial blessings during which both the oath and the consequences of breaking it are set: if any of the sworn break this vow, they are struck by a curse. For each individual that does so, you choose one of the options given in the bestow curse spell. When the oath is broken, all participants are immediately aware that this has occurred, but they know no other details. The curse effect of binding oath can’t be dismissed by dispel magic, but it can be removed with dispel evil and good, remove curse, or wish. Remove curse functions only if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast binding oath. Depending on the nature of the oath, one creature’s breaking it may or may not invalidate the oath for the other targets. If the oath is completely broken, the spell ends for every affected creature, but curse effects already bestowed remain until dispelled.
  <em>Biting Arrow</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 153) – As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with a bow, a crossbow, or a thrown weapon. The effect is limited to a range of 120 feet despite the weapon’s range, and the attack is made with disadvantage if the target is in the weapon’s long range. If the weapon attack hits, it deals damage as usual. In addition, the target becomes coated in thin frost until the start of your next turn. If the target uses its reaction before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d6 cold damage and the spell ends. The spell’s damage, for both the ranged attack and the cold damage, increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (+1d6 and 2d6), 11th level (+2d6 and 3d6), and 17th level (+3d6 and 4d6).
  <em>Alter Arrow's Fortune</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 143) – You clap your hands, setting off a chain of tiny events that culminate in throwing off an enemy’s aim. When an enemy makes a ranged attack with a weapon or a spell that hits one of your allies, this spell causes the enemy to reroll the attack roll unless the enemy makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The attack is resolved using the lower of the two rolls (effectively giving the enemy disadvantage on the attack).
  <em>Alter Time Flow</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 143) – You control the currents of time, affecting all creatures within 30 feet of yourself. You can choose to deliver either a haste or slow effect (as the spell) to each creature in the area. An unwilling creature makes a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. Each unwilling creature must make a new saving throw if it remains in the affected area at the end of its turn. Any affected creature returns to normal if it exits the area, but if a creature reenters the area while the spell is still active, it is subject to the effect of the spell (and receives another saving throw, if unwilling).
  <em>Althea's Travel Tent</em> (2nd-Level (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 143) – You touch an ordinary, properly pitched canvas tent to create a space where you and a companion can sleep in comfort. From the outside, the tent appears normal, but inside it has a small foyer and a larger bedchamber. The foyer contains a writing desk with a chair; the bedchamber holds a soft bed large enough to sleep two, a small nightstand with a candle, and a small clothes rack. The floor of both rooms is a clean, dry, hard‐packed version of the local ground. When the spell ends, the tent and the ground return to normal, and any creatures inside the tent are expelled to the nearest unoccupied spaces. At Higher Levels. When the spell is cast using a 3rd‐ level slot, the foyer becomes a dining area with seats for six and enough floor space for six people to sleep, if they bring their own bedding. The sleeping room is unchanged. With a 4th‐level slot, the temperature inside the tent is comfortable regardless of the outside temperature, and the dining area includes a small kitchen. With a 5th‐level slot, an unseen servant is conjured to prepare and serve food (from your supplies). With a 6th‐level slot, a third room is added that has three two‐person beds. With a slot of 7th level or higher, the dining area and second sleeping area can each accommodate eight persons.
  <em>Amplify Gravity</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 143) – This spell intensifies gravity in a 50‐foot‐radius area within range. Inside the area, damage from falling is quadrupled (2d6 per 5 feet fallen) and maximum damage from falling is 40d6. Any creature on the ground in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked prone; the same applies to a creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A prone creature in the area must make a successful Strength saving throw to stand up. A creature on the ground in the area moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and ranged attack rolls.
  <em>Amplify Light</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 143) – You touch a nonmagical light source and increase its brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light extends for the same distance beyond that area. The light source’s duration is halved, however, so that a torch affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours. Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its normal brightness.
  <em>Energy Absorption</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 192) – A creature you touch has resistance to acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, and thunder damage until the spell ends. If the spell is used against an unwilling creature, you must make a melee spell attack with a reach of 5 feet. If the attack hits, for the duration of the spell the affected creature must make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability whenever it casts a spell that deals one of the given damage types. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but its slot is expended; on a successful save, the spell is cast but its damage is halved before applying the effects of saving throws, resistance, and other factors.
  <em>Energy Foreknowledge</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 192) – When you cast this spell, you gain resistance to every type of energy listed above that is dealt by the spell hitting you. This resistance lasts until the end of your next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can include one additional ally in its effect for each slot level above 4th. Affected allies must be within 15 feet of you.
  <em>Enhance Familiar</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 192) – You temporarily imbue your familiar with power, making it larger, tougher, and more vicious. While the spell lasts, your familiar has all the statistics of the giant version of its type, except for the fish (quipper), which has the statistics of a reef shark. Your familiar retains all its special abilities as described in the find familiar spell. If your familiar drops to 0 hit points and disappears, or you dismiss your familiar, the spell ends, and your familiar is returned to its normal form when you next summon it. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, its duration is 1 hour and does not require concentration. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 24 hours.
  <em>Enhance Greed</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 192) – You detect precious metals, gems, and jewelry within 60 feet. You do not discern their exact location, only their presence and direction. Their exact location is revealed if you are within 10 feet of the spot. Enhance greed penetrates barriers but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of dirt or wood. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 1 minute, and another 10 feet can be added to its range, for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Entomb</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 192) – You cause slabs of rock to burst out of the ground or other stone surface to form a hollow, 10‐foot cube within range. A creature inside the cube when it forms must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be trapped inside the stone tomb. The tomb is airtight, with enough air for a single Medium or Small creature to breathe for 8 hours. If more than one creature is trapped inside, divide the time evenly between all the occupants. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures. If the creature is still trapped inside when the air runs out, it begins to suffocate. The tomb has AC 18 and 50 hit points. It is resistant to fire, cold, lightning, bludgeoning, and slashing damage, is immune to poison and psychic damage, and is vulnerable to thunder damage. When reduced to 0 hit points, the tomb crumbles into harmless powder.
  <em>Abhorrent Apparition</em> (4th-level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 100) – You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Radiant Beacon</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 237) – A pillar of brilliant light falls from the air, filling the square you are in and the area within 5 feet of you. Each other creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. For the duration, a pillar of brilliant radiance shines around you and moves with you. It sheds bright light in a 10‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is sunlight. This spell’s light can be seen from a distance of up to 10 miles outdoors at night or 5 miles during twilight.
  <em>Raid The Lair</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 237) – You create an invisible circle of protective energy centered on yourself with a radius of 10 feet. This field moves with you. The caster and all allies within the energy field are protected against dragons’ lair actions:  • Attack rolls resulting directly from lair actions are made with disadvantage.  • Saving throws resulting directly from lair actions are made with advantage, and damage done by these lair actions is halved.  • Lair actions occur on an initiative count 10 lower than normal.  The caster has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on this spell.
  <em>Rain Of Blades</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 237) – You call down a rain of swords, spears, and axes. The blades fill 150 square feet (six 5‐foot squares, a circle 15 feet in diameter, or any other pattern you want as long as it forms one contiguous space at least 5 feet wide in all places. The blades deal 6d6 slashing damage to each creature in the area at the moment the spell is cast, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. An intelligent undead injured by the blades is frightened for 1d4 rounds if it fails a Charisma saving throw. Most of the blades break or are driven into the ground on impact, but enough survive intact that any single piercing or slashing melee weapon can be salvaged from the affected area and used normally if it is claimed before the spell ends. When the duration expires, all the blades (including the one that was salvaged) disappear. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, an unbroken blade can be picked up and used as a magical +1 weapon until it disappears.

  <em>Life Transference Arrow</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 223) – You create a glowing arrow of necrotic magic and command it to strike a creature you can see within range. The arrow can have one of two effects; you choose which at the moment of casting. If you make a successful ranged spell attack, you and the target experience the desired effect. If the attack misses, the spell fails:  • The arrow deals 2d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you heal the same amount of hit points. • You take 2d6 necrotic damage, and the target heals the same amount of hit points.
  <em>Litany Of Sure Hands</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 223) – This spell allows a creature within range to quickly perform a simple task (other than attacking or casting a spell) as a bonus action on its turn. Examples include finding an item in a backpack, drinking a potion, and pulling a rope. Other actions may also fall into this category, depending on the GM’s ruling. The target also ignores the loading property of weapons.
  <em>Lock Armor</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 223) – You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces  against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in its area.
  <em>Green Mantle</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – You take on the physical characteristics of the terrain around you. In a forest, grass and tiny mushrooms sprout in your hair, moss beards your chin, and your flesh takes on the mottled hue of leaf green and bark brown. In an arctic grassland, gray lichens and the various shades of boreal grasses cloak your presence. This effect provides a +2 bonus to Stealth checks in the appropriate terrain.
  <em>Grudge Match</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – This spell affects any creatures you designate within range, as long as the group contains an equal number of allies and enemies. If the number of allies and enemies targeted isn’t the same, the spell fails. For the duration of the spell, each target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls made involving other targets of the spell. All affected creatures can identify fellow targets of the spell by sight. If an affected creature makes any of the above rolls against a non‐target, it takes a –2 penalty on that roll.
  <em>Guiding Star</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – By observing the stars or the position of the sun, you are able to determine the cardinal directions, as well as the direction and distance to a stated destination. You can’t become directionally disoriented or lose track of the destination. The spell doesn’t, however, reveal the best route to your destination or warn you about deep gorges, flooded rivers, or other impassable or treacherous terrain.
  <em>Hamstring</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – You send an arrow of eldritch energy at a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 force damage, and it can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. The spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
  <em>Hard Heart</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – You imbue your touch with the power to make a creature aloof, hardhearted, and unfeeling. The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this save unless it’s currently charmed. On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being charmed for the duration; if it’s currently charmed, that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell’s duration.
  <em>Harry</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 207) – You instill an irresistible sense of insecurity and terror in the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid your notice and is frightened of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target, and the target can’t take a long rest, terrified that you are just around the corner. The target can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes, ending the spell on a success. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
  <em>Wresting Wind</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 278) – By blowing a pinch of confetti from your cupped hand, you create a burst of air that can rip weapons and other items out of the hands of your enemies. Each enemy in a 20-foot radius centered on a point you target within range must make a successful Strength saving throw or drop anything held in its hands. The objects land 10 feet away from the creatures that dropped them, in random directions.
  <em>Writhing Arms</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 278) – Your arms become constantly writhing tentacles. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack against any target within range. The target takes 1d10 necrotic damage and is grappled (escape DC is your spell save DC). If the target does not escape your grapple, you can use your action on each subsequent turn to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically.  Although you control the tentacles, they make it difficult to manipulate items. You cannot wield weapons or hold objects, including material components, while under the effects of this spell.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage you deal with your tentacle attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Yellow Sign</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 278) – You attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long‐ term madness and be charmed by you for the duration of the spell or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as a sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the creature, it has advantage on its saving throw. A successful remove curse spell ends both effects.
  <em>Spur Mount</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 253) – You urge your mount to a sudden burst of speed. Until the end of your next turn, you can direct your mount to use the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action. This spell has no effect on a creature that you are not riding.
  <em>Spy My Shadow</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 253) – You bring your shadow to life as a tenebrous spy that can slip under doors, between shutters, and through the narrowest of cracks. You can stretch your shadow up to ten times your height and move it as you desire. It remains two‐dimensional and cannot interact with physical objects.  You can spy through your shadow’s eyes and ears as if they were your own, but magically enhanced senses do not work through this spell. You can utilize the Stealth skill normally if trying to keep your shadow’s presence a secret: it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in dim lighting but disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in brightly lit areas.
  <em>Staff Of Violet Fire</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 253) – You create a quarterstaff of pure necrotic energy that blazes with intense purple light; it appears in your chosen hand. If you let it go, it disappears, though you can evoke it again as a bonus action if you have maintained concentration on the spell.  This staff is an extremely unstable and impermanent magic item; it has 10 charges and does not require attunement. The wielder can use one of three effects:  • By using your action to make a melee attack and expending 1 charge, you can attack with it. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 necrotic damage.  • By expending 2 charges, you can release bolts of necrotic fire against up to 3 targets as ranged attacks for 1d8+4 necrotic damage each.  The staff disappears and the spell ends when all the staff ’s charges have been expended or if you stop concentrating on the spell.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the melee damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 4th, or you add one additional ranged bolt for every two slot levels above 4th.
  <em>Stanch</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – The target’s blood coagulates rapidly, so that a dying target stabilizes and any ongoing bleeding or wounding effect on the target ends. The target can’t be the source of blood for any spell or effect that requires even a drop of blood.
  <em>Star's Heart</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50‐foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it’s holding, falls prone, becomes incapacitated, and can’t move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed. All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as flaming sphere. A creature under the influence of a freedom of movement spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.
  <em>Starburst</em> (Evocation Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – You cause a mote of starlight to appear and explode in a 5‐foot cube you can see within range. If a creature is in the cube, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. This spell’s damage increases to 2d8 when you reach 5th level, 3d8 when you reach 11th level, and 4d8 when you reach 17th level.
  <em>Starfall</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – You cause bolts of shimmering starlight to fall from the heavens, striking up to five creatures that you can see within range. Each bolt strikes one target, dealing 6d6 radiant damage, knocking the target prone, and blinding it until the start of your next turn. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage, is not knocked prone, and is not blinded. If you name fewer than five targets, excess bolts strike the ground harmlessly. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create one additional bolt for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Starry Vision</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – This spell acts as compelling fate, except as noted above (starry vision can be cast as a reaction, has twice the range of compelling fate, and lasts up to 1 minute). At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the bonus to AC increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.
  <em>Steal Warmth</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 254) – When you cast steal warmth after taking cold damage, you select a living creature within 5 feet of you. That creature takes the cold damage instead, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. You regain hit points equal to the amount of cold damage taken by the target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the distance to the target you can affect with this spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Withered Sight</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 277) – You cause the eyes of a creature you can see within range to lose acuity. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and all attack rolls for the duration of the spell. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This spell has no effect on a creature that is blind or that doesn’t use its eyes to see.
  <em>Wolfsong</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 277) – You emit a howl that can be heard clearly from 300 feet away outdoors. The howl can convey a message of up to nine words, which can be understood by all dogs and wolves in that area, as well as (if you choose) one specific creature of any kind that you name when casting the spell. If you cast the spell indoors and aboveground, the howl can be heard out to 200 feet from you. If you cast the spell underground, the howl can be heard from 100 feet away. A creature that understands the message is not compelled to act in a particular way, though the nature of the message might suggest or even dictate a course of action.
  <em>Looping Trail</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 224) – You touch a trail no more than 1 mile in length, reconfiguring it to give it switchbacks and curves that make the trail loop back on itself. For the duration, the trail makes subtle changes in its configuration and in the surrounding environment to give the impression of forward progression along a continuous path. A creature on the trail must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check to notice that the trail is leading it in a closed loop.
  <em>Lovesick</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 224) – This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions of someone who has fallen head over heels in love. Each creature in a 10‐foot‐radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns and consult the table below to determine its behavior for that turn. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Lower The Veil</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 224) – You drop the veil of reality for selected targets, allowing a brief glimpse into the deep nothing beyond this realm to shatter their minds. Each creature you choose within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 8d10 psychic damage and be driven insane for 10 minutes, per the symbol spell. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the damage and is stunned for 1 round. Creatures already suffering from insanity are immune to this spell. Blindness, however, is not a defense, since the experience is not sight‐based, but an internal awareness.
  <em>Luminous Bolt</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 224) – A ray of sunlight shoots out at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d6 radiant damage, and it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Green Decay</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 500) – Your touch inflicts a nauseating, alien rot. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with the supernatural disease green decay (see below), and creatures within 15 feet of the target who can see it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. You lose concentration on this spell if you can’t see the target at the end of your turn. Green Decay. The flesh of a creature that has this disease is slowly consumed by a virulent extraterrestrial fungus. While the disease persists, the creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom saving throws, and it has vulnerability to acid, fire, and necrotic damage. An affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If the creature gets three successes on these saving throws before it gets three failures, the disease ends immediately (but the damage and the hit point maximum reduction remain in effect). If the creature gets three failures on these saving throws before it gets three successes, the disease lasts for the duration of the spell, and no further saving throws are allowed.
  <em>Mithral Dragon's Might</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 228) – You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of the mithral dragon, growing protective scales, wings, and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be lower than 16, regardless of what armor you are wearing. You can take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws, dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You have resistance to acid and thunder damage. Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20‐foot cone of metal shards, dealing 6d8 slashing damage to all creatures in the cone. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon. Finally, the wings grant you a flying speed of 40 feet.
  <em>Monstrous Empathy</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 228) – This spell lets you forge a connection with a monstrosity. Choose a monstrosity that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the monstrosity’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the monstrosity must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional monstrosity for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Mortal Insight</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 228) – A supernatural olfactory sense allows you to smell wounded living creatures. Until the spell ends, you can pinpoint a creature that doesn’t have all of its hit points within 30 feet of you, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track a creature that doesn’t have all of its hit points. In addition, you have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all of its hit points. The spell has no effect on creatures that don’t have blood.
  <em>Ravages Of Time</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 238) – You accelerate the aging of one creature within range, causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its type. The target suffers three levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed by normal means. A greater restoration spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one level of exhaustion. Constructs and undead are unaffected by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.
  <em>Ray Of Alchemical Negation</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 238) – You launch a ray of blazing, polychromatic energy from your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against an alchemical item or a trap that uses alchemy to achieve its ends, such as a trap that sprays acid, releases poisonous gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemist’s fire. A hit destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable object Armor Class. This spell can also be used against a creature within range that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous, or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem or an ochre jelly. In that case, a hit deals 6d6 force damage, and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or it deals only half as much damage with its acidic, poisonous, or alchemical attacks for 1 minute. A creature whose damage is halved can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
  <em>Ray Of Life Suppression</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 238) – You launch a swirling ray of disruptive energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes 6d8 necrotic damage and its maximum hit points are reduced by an equal amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest, or until it receives the benefit of a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.
  <em>Read Object</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 238) – By handling an object and reading the psychic residue on it, you can divine information about the item’s history. After you cast the spell, you continue to handle the object, reading any impressions that might be left upon it. Each round, the GM may give you one piece of information related to the item’s ownership and handling. The GM might determine that a particular item does not have enough psychic residue to provide any clear impressions. The following are examples of information you can obtain through use of this spell: • The item’s name, if it has one. • A visual image of the last creature to handle the item. • An impression of the emotional state of the creature that last used the item. • If the item is a weapon, or has been used as a weapon, an image of the last creature injured or killed by it. • A visual image of the item’s owner or crafter. • Information regarding the item’s historical significance, if any.
  <em>Reaver Spirit</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 238) – You inspire allies to fight with the savagery of berserkers. You and any allies you can see within range have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and a +2 bonus to damage with melee weapons. When the spell ends, each affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1d4 levels of exhaustion. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus to damage increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Chaotic World</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 168) – You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later, a 30‐foot cube centered on a point within range fills with multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering scents, and other confusing sensory information. The effect is dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or become blinded and deafened and fall prone. An affected enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness or deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end immediately for a creature that leaves the spell’s area.
  <em>Cherub's Burning Blade</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 168) – A sword made of holy fire blazes to life in your hand. The size and shape of the blade conforms to your will, but it is never larger than a one‐handed weapon sized for a Medium creature. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but if you maintain concentration on the spell, you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can use your action to make a melee attack with the burning blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 radiant damage. On a critical hit, the target catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The burning blade sheds bright light in a 10‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both the fire damage and radiant damage increase by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 4th.
  <em>Child Of Light And Darkness</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 168) – Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 1–10, you take the form of a humanoid made of pure, searing light. On a roll of 11–20, you take the form of a humanoid made of bone‐chilling darkness. In both forms, you have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the attack roll. You gain additional benefits while in either form. In Light Form. You shed bright light in a 60‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet, you are immune to fire damage, and you have resistance to radiant damage. Once per turn as a bonus action, you can teleport to a space you can see within the light you shed. In Darkness Form. You are immune to cold damage, and you have resistance to necrotic damage. Once per turn as a bonus action, you can target up to three Large or smaller creatures within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled or pushed (your choice) up to 20 feet straight toward or away from you.
  <em>Elemental Horns</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – The target of this spell must be a creature that has horns, or the spell fails. Elemental horns causes the touched creature’s horns to crackle with elemental energy. Select one of the following energy types when casting this spell: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or radiant. The creature’s gore attack deals 3d6 damage of the chosen type in addition to any other damage the attack normally deals. Although commonly seen among tieflings and minotaurs, this spell is rarely employed by other races. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Elemental Twist</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – During this spell’s duration, reality shifts around you whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage. Assign each damage type a number and roll a d6 to determine the type of damage this casting of the spell deals. In addition, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6. All other properties or effects of the spell are unchanged.
  <em>Emanation Of Yoth</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – You call forth a ghost that takes the form of a spectral, serpentlike assassin. It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The ghost disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The ghost is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. Roll initiative for the ghost, which takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue a command to it, the ghost defends itself from hostile creatures but doesn’t move or take other actions. You are immune to the ghost’s Horrifying Visage action but can willingly become the target of the ghost’s Possession ability. You can end this effect on yourself as a bonus action. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you call forth two ghosts. If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you call forth three ghosts.
  <em>Enchant Ring</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – You enchant a ring you touch that isn’t being worn or carried. The next creature that willingly wears the ring becomes charmed by you for 1 week or until it is harmed by you or one of your allies. If the creature dons the ring while directly threatened by you or one of your allies, the spell fails. The charmed creature regards you as a friend. When the spell ends, it doesn’t know it was charmed by you, but it does realize that its attitude toward you has changed (possibly greatly) in a short time. How the creature reacts to you and regards you in the future is up to the GM.
  <em>Encrypt / Decrypt</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – By touching a page of written information, you can encode its contents. All creatures that try to read the information when its contents are encoded see the markings on the page as nothing but gibberish. The effect ends when either encrypt / decrypt or dispel magic is cast on the encoded writing, which turns it back into its normal state.
  <em>Endow Attribute</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 191) – You touch a creature with a ring that has been etched with symbols representing a particular ability (Strength, Dexterity, and so forth). The creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose one‐fifth  (rounded down) of its points from that ability score. Those points are absorbed into the ring and stored there for the spell’s duration. If you then use an action to touch the ring to another creature on a later turn, the absorbed ability score points transfer to that creature. Once the points are transferred to another creature, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell; the recipient creature retains the transferred ability score points for the remainder of the hour. The spell ends if you lose concentration before the transfer takes place, if either the target or the recipient dies, or if either the target or the recipient is affected by  a successful dispel magic spell. When the spell ends, the ability score points return to the original owner. Before then, that creature can’t regain the stolen attribute points, even with greater restoration or comparable magic. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a 9th‐level spell slot, the duration is 24 hours.
  <em>Agonizing Mark</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – You choose a creature you can see within range to mark as your prey, and a ray of black energy issues forth from you. Until the spell ends, each time you deal damage to the target it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone as its body is filled with torturous agony.
  <em>Alchemical Form</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – You transform into an amoebic form composed of highly acidic and poisonous alchemical jelly. While in this form: • You are immune to acid and poison damage and to the poisoned and stunned conditions. • You have resistance to nonmagical fire, piercing, and slashing damage. • You can’t speak, cast spells, use items or weapons, or manipulate objects. • Your gear melds into your body and reappears when the spell ends. • You don’t need to breathe. • Your speed is 20 feet. • Your size doesn’t change, but you can move through and between obstructions as if you were two size categories smaller. • You gain the following action: Melee Weapon Attack: spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus to hit, range 5 ft., one target; Hit: 4d6 acid or poison damage (your choice), and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Ale-Dritch Blast</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – A stream of ice‐cold ale blasts from your outstretched hands toward a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage and it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. A targeted creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has drunk any alcohol within the last hour. The damage increases when you reach higher levels: 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.
  <em>Allure</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Charisma check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Ally Aegis</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – When you see an ally within range in imminent danger, you can use your reaction to protect that creature with a shield of magical force. Until the start of your next turn, your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemy’s spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Alone</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 142) – You cause a creature within range to believe its allies have been banished to a different realm. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it treats its allies as if they were invisible and silenced. The affected creature cannot target, perceive, or otherwise interact with its allies for the duration of the spell. If one of its allies hits it with a melee attack, the affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
  <em>Bitter Chains</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 154) – The spiked ring in your hand expands into a long, barbed chain to ensnare a creature you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is bound in metal chains for the duration. While bound, the target can move only at half speed and has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and Dexterity checks. If it moves more than 5 feet during a turn, it takes 3d6 piercing damage from the barbs. The creature can escape from the chains by using an action and making a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC, or if the chains are destroyed. The chains have AC 18 and 20 hit points.
  <em>Black Goat's Blessing</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 154) – You raise your hand with fingers splayed and utter an incantation of the Black Goat with a Thousand Young. Your magic is blessed with the eldritch virility of the All-Mother. The target has disadvantage on saving throws against spells you cast until the end of your next turn.
  <em>Black Sunshine</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 154) – You hold up a flawed pearl and it disappears, leaving behind a magic orb in your hand that pulses with dim purple light. Allies that you designate become invisible if they're within 60 feet of you and if light from the orb can reach the space they occupy. An invisible creature still casts a faint, purple shadow. The orb can be used as a thrown weapon to attack an enemy. On a hit, the orb explodes in a flash of light and the spell ends. The targeted enemy and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Black Swan Storm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 154) – You call forth a whirlwind of black feathers that fills a 5-foot cube within range. The feathers deal 2d8 force damage to creatures in the cube's area and radiate darkness, causing the illumination level within 20 feet of the cube to drop by one step (from bright light to dim light, and from dim light to darkness). Creatures that make a successful Dexterity saving throw take half the damage and are still affected by the change in light. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the feathers deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Blade Of My Brother</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 154) – You touch a melee weapon that was used by an ally who is now dead, and it leaps into the air and flies to another ally (chosen by you) within 15 feet of you. The weapon enters that ally's space and moves when the ally moves. If the weapon or the ally is forced to move more than 5 feet from the other, the spell ends. The weapon acts on your turn by making an attack if a target presents itself. Its attack modifier equals your spellcasting level + the weapon's inherent magical bonus, if any; it receives only its own inherent magical bonus to damage. The weapon fights for up to 4 rounds or until your concentration is broken, after which the spell ends, and it falls to the ground.
  <em>Dead Walking</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 183) – This spell makes up to six willing creatures you can see within range invisible to undead for the duration. Anything a target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for all targets if one target attacks or casts a spell.
  <em>Deadly Sting</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 183) – You grow a 10‐foot‐long tail as supple as a whip, tipped with a horrible stinger. During the spell’s duration, you can use the stinger to make a melee spell attack with a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage plus 4d10 poison damage, and a creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become vulnerable to poison damage for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Death God's Touch</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 183) – This spell allows you to shred the life force of a creature you touch. You become invisible and make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies. Whether the attack hits or misses, you remain invisible until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Decay</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 183) – Make a melee spell attack against a creature you touch. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 necrotic damage.
  <em>Decelerate</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 183) – You slow the flow of time around a creature within range that you can see. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5‐foot increment). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a failed save the target’s speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. Decelerate can’t reduce a creature’s speed to less than 5 feet.
  <em>Clumsiness</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 172) – You temporarily make a creature within range less dexterous. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Dexterity check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Cobra Fangs</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 172) – The spell causes the target to grow great, snake‐like fangs. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell fails if the target already has a bite attack that deals poison damage. If the target doesn’t have a bite attack, it gains one. The target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4. When the target hits a creature with its bite attack, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target’s bite counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
  <em>Command Undead</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 172) – You speak a one‐word command to all undead creatures you can see within range. Any target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is living, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.
  <em>Compelled Movement</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 172) – Choose two living creatures (not constructs or undead) you can see within range. Each must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is compelled to use its movement to move toward the other creature. Its route must be as direct as possible, but it avoids dangerous terrain and enemies. If the creatures are within 5 feet of each other at the end of either one’s turn, their bodies fuse together. Fused creatures still take their own turns, but they can’t move, can’t use reactions, and have disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution checks to maintain concentration. A fused creature can use its action to make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and can move as it wants. It can become fused again, however, if it’s within 5 feet of a creature that’s still under the spell’s effect at the end of either creature’s turn. Compelled movement doesn’t affect a creature that can’t be charmed or that is incorporeal. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of creatures you can affect increases by one for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Compelling Fate</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 172) – You view the actions of a single creature you can see through the influence of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the following effects: • You have advantage on attack rolls against the target. • For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn’s movement. • As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Gift Of Luck</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – You grant a touched creature a limited gift of luck. While the spell lasts, the target can gain advantage on any three rolls of its choice. Once three rolls have been affected by the gift of luck, the spell ends.
  <em>Gift Of Resilience</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – A willing creature you touch has advantage on the first three death saving throws it attempts before the duration of the spell expires.
  <em>Gird The Spirit</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – Your magic protects the target creature from the life‐ sapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a shadow’s Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a specter’s Life Drain. This spell doesn’t prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.
  <em>Glacial Cascade</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – By harnessing the power of ice and frost, you emanate pure cold, filling a 30‐foot‐radius sphere. Creatures other than you in the sphere take 10d8 cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature killed by this spell is transformed into ice, leaving behind no trace of its original body.
  <em>Glacial Fog</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – As you cast this spell, a 30‐foot‐radius sphere centered on a point within range becomes covered in a frigid fog. Each creature that is in the area at the start of its turn while the spell remains in effect must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 cold damage and gains one level of exhaustion, and it has disadvantage on Perception checks until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and ignores the other effects. Stored devices and tools are all frozen by the fog: crossbow mechanisms become sluggish, weapons are stuck in scabbards, potions turn to ice, bag cords freeze together, and so forth. Such items require the application of heat for 1 round or longer in order to become useful again.
  <em>Glamor Of Mundanity</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 203) – You lay a glamor upon a touched creature that makes it easily overlooked and forgettable. For the duration of the spell, any Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the target, or any ability checks made to recall details about the target or any interactions with it, are made with disadvantage. The target gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks but has disadvantage on any Charisma checks made while under the glamor.
  <em>Hero's Steel</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 210) – You infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon’s wielder has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon’s wielder currently has, it becomes frightened instead; a frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for 24 hours.
  <em>Hoarfrost</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 210) – A melee weapon you are holding is imbued with cold. For the duration, a rime of frost covers the weapon and light vapor rises from it if the temperature is above freezing. The weapon becomes magical and deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a successful hit. The spell ends after 1 minute, or earlier if you make a successful attack with the weapon or let go of it. The spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
  <em>Hobble</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 210) – You create an ethereal trap in the space of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
  <em>Hobble Mount</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 210) – When you cast hobble mount as a successful melee spell attack against a horse, wolf, or other four‐legged or two‐legged beast being ridden as a mount, that beast is disabled so that it can’t move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed in a turn takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
  <em>Holy Ground</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 210) – You invoke divine powers to bless the ground within 60 feet of you. Creatures slain in the affected area cannot be raised as undead by magic or by the abilities of monsters, even if the corpse is later removed from the area. Any spell of 4th level or lower that would summon or animate undead within the area fails automatically. Such spells cast with spell slots of 5th level or higher function normally. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of spells that are prevented from functioning increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Celestial Fanfare</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 166) – A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30‐foot radius take 4d6 thunder damage and 4d6 radiant damage and are blinded and deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the duration of the blinded and deafened conditions by half. Neutral or unaligned creatures take half as much damage and are blinded and deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to one‐quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects. Good‐aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
  <em>Chains Of Perdition</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 166) – Lengths of iron chain appear near a creature you choose within range, possibly ensnaring the target and causing it physical and mental suffering. The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the chains and take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 psychic damage. The creature takes this damage on your turn every round that it remains restrained by the chains. On its turn, a restrained creature can make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. The chains remain until the spell ends. If they are not restraining a creature, you can use a bonus action to direct the chains to target the same creature or another one, moving the chains up to 20 feet (within the range of the spell) if necessary to do so. If the chains move beyond the maximum range, the spell ends. The chains can be destroyed; treat them as an object with AC 18, 15 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage and 1d8 psychic damage for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Chains Of The Goddess</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 166) – Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be restrained by chains of psychic force and take 6d8 bludgeoning damage. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. While restrained in this way, the creature also takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns.
  <em>Chains Of Torment</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 166) – You are surrounded by dim light in a 10‐foot radius as you conjure an iron chain that extends out to a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While grappled in this way, the creature is also restrained. A creature that’s restrained at the start of its turn takes 4d6 psychic damage. You can have only one creature restrained in this way at a time. As an action, you can scan the mind of the creature that’s restrained by your chain. If the creature gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, you learn one discrete piece of information of your choosing known by the creature (such as a name, a password, or an important number). The effect is otherwise harmless. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Champion's Weapon</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 166) – A spectral version of a melee weapon of your choice materializes in your hand. It has standard statistics for a weapon of its kind, but it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type and it sheds dim light in a 10‐foot radius. You have proficiency with this weapon for the spell’s duration. The weapon can be wielded only by the caster; the spell ends if the weapon is held by a creature other than you or if you start your turn more than 10 feet from the weapon. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 force damage for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Sun's Bounty</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 258) – The sun’s life‐giving energy heals and sustains your body or that of a creature you touch. For the duration, you heal 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns whenever you are bathed in direct sunlight; 30 minutes or more of exposure also provides a day’s normal nourishment. In dim light, the spell’s healing is reduced to 1 hit point per minute. Normal or magical darkness suppresses the spell’s effect entirely. While in sunlight, the target can ignore one level of exhaustion. (The level is only temporarily removed.) Undead are especially vulnerable to this spell. If a targeted undead fails its Wisdom save, it gains the poisoned condition and suffers radiant damage instead of healing while in sunlight. 
  <em>Surge Dampener</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 258) – Using your strength of will, you cause one creature other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly entrenched within reality that it is protected from the effects of a chaos magic surge. The protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by surge dampener, the spell ends. 
  <em>Surprise Blessing</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 258) – You touch a willing creature and choose one of the conditions listed below that the creature is currently subjected to. The condition’s normal effect on the target is suspended, and the indicated effect applies instead. This spell’s effect on the target lasts for the duration of the original condition or until the spell ends. If this spell ends before the original condition’s duration expires, you become affected by the condition for as long as it lasts, even if you were not the original recipient of the condition. Blinded. The target gains truesight out to a range of 10 feet and can see 10 feet into the Ethereal Plane. Charmed. The target’s Charisma score becomes 19, unless it is already higher than 19, and it gains immunity to charm effects. Frightened. The target emits a 10‐foot‐radius aura of dread. Each creature the target designates that starts its turn in the aura must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the target. A creature frightened in this way that starts its turn outside the aura repeats the saving throw, ending the condition on itself on a success. Paralyzed. The target can use one extra bonus action or reaction per round. Petrified. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC. Poisoned. The target heals 2d6 hit points at the start of its next turn, and it gains immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Stunned. The target has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. 
  <em>Swift Exchange</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 258) – When you or another creature you can see within range is the target of a weapon attack or a spell attack, you can magically switch your position with that of the other creature in an instant. If the creature is unwilling, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. Otherwise, you and the creature change positions, each appearing in an eyeblink at the location the other previously occupied. Any attack that was about to occur against you or the other creature is resolved against whichever one of you now occupies the targeted space.
  <em>Warp Mind And Matter</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 274) – A creature you can see within range undergoes a baleful transmogrification. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or suffer a flesh warp and be afflicted with a form of indefinite madness.
  <em>Wave Of Corruption</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 274) – When you cast this spell, necromantic energy spreads out in a 30‐foot radius around you, corrupting what it comes into contact with. Each unattended, nonmagical object within range takes 3d8 necrotic damage. All food and drink in the area, other than what is being carried, is fouled and made unpalatable. Magic consumables, such as potions, have a 50 percent chance of being ruined, but any such item in the possession of a creature gets a Constitution saving throw using the owner’s save bonus to avoid this outcome. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Wayward Strike</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg ) – You create a tear in the fabric of reality that protects you from an incoming attack by directing it through a second tear close to a creature you can see up within range. The attack plunges into one dimensional tear and out the other one, causing it to be resolved against that creature’s AC. If the attack is successful, the creature takes the appropriate damage. You can even make the attacker hit itself, if you choose.
  <em>Draconic Majesty</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – You exude the powerful presence of a dragon, frightening your enemies. For the duration of the spell, all creatures who are aware of your presence and within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Draconic Senses</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – You enhance your senses, granting yourself the keen perception of a dragon. For the duration of the spell, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet. You also gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.
  <em>Draconic Smite</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell’s duration, your weapon takes on the form of a silver dragon’s head. Your attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage, and up to four other creatures of your choosing within 30 feet of the attack’s target must each make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage.
  <em>Dragon Breath</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – You summon draconic power to gain a breath weapon. When you cast dragon breath, you can immediately exhale a cone or line of elemental energy, depending on the type of dragon you select. While the spell remains active, roll a d6 at the start of your turn. On a roll of 5 or 6, you can take a bonus action that turn to use the breath weapon again. When you cast the spell, choose one of the dragon types listed below. Your choice determines the affected area and the damage of the breath attack for the spell’s duration.
  <em>Dragon Roar</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – Your voice is amplified to assault the mind of one creature. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is frightened until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by your dragon roar only once per 24 hours. This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
  <em>Dragon's Pride</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 187) – Your sense of self grows to draconic proportions. Until the spell ends, you gain advantage on all Charisma checks and on all saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
  <em>Chilling Words</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 169) – You utter a short phrase and designate a creature within range to be affected by it. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the spell. On a failed save, the target is susceptible to the phrase for the duration of the spell. At any later time while the spell is in effect, you and any of your allies within range when you cast the spell can use an action to utter the phrase, which causes the target to freeze in fear. Each of you can use the phrase against the target once only, and the target must be within 30 feet of the speaker for the phrase to be effective. When the target hears the phrase, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and become restrained for 1 round. Whether this saving throw succeeds or fails, the target can’t be affected by the phrase for 1 minute afterward. You can end the spell early by making a final utterance of the phrase (even if you’ve used the phrase on this target previously). On hearing this final utterance, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage and is restrained for 1 minute or, with a successful Constitution saving throw, it takes half the damage and is restrained for 1 round.
  <em>Chronal Lance</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 169) – You inflict the ravages of aging on up to three creatures within range, temporarily discomfiting them and making them appear elderly for a time. Each target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5‐foot increment) and it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks (but not saving throws). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Circle Of Devastation</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 169) – You create a 10‐foot‐tall, 20‐foot‐radius cylinder of destructive energy around a point you can see within range. The area is difficult terrain. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant. Each creature or object that is inside the cylinder when it’s created or ends its turn inside the cylinder takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature or object dropped to 0 hit points by the spell is reduced to fine ash. The cylinder’s radius expands by 20 feet at the start of each of your turns after the spell is cast. Any creatures or objects enveloped in the enlarged area are subject to its effects immediately.
  <em>Steam Blast</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 255) – You unleash a burst of superheated steam in a 15‐foot radius around you. All other creatures in the area take 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. Nonmagical fires smaller than a bonfire are extinguished, and everything becomes wet.
  <em>Steam Whistle</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 255) – You open your mouth and unleash a shattering scream. All other creatures in a 30‐foot radius around you take 10d10 thunder damage and are deafened for 1d8 hours. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and reduces the deafness to 1 round.
  <em>Step Like Me</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 255) – Choose a creature within one size category of yourself that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or you steal its footsteps. For the duration of the spell, you leave the tracks of the target, while it leaves tracks as if it were you. In addition, those capable of identifying creatures through tremorsense mistake you for a creature of the target’s kind.
  <em>Sting Of The Scorpion Goddess</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 255) – You grow a large scorpion’s tail, complete with venomous stinger. While the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the stinger against an opponent within 5 feet. On a hit, you deal 1d6 piercing damage and 2d8 poison damage, and the target is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature hit by your stinger attack makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes just half the poison damage and is not poisoned.
  <em>Storm Form</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 255) – You transform into a living storm cloud, becoming a swirling mass of black clouds illuminated from within by flickers of lightning. While in this form, your only method of movement is a flying speed of 60 feet. You can enter and occupy the space of another creature. You have resistance to nonmagical damage, immunity to lightning damage, and advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. If a creature strikes you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 3d8 lightning damage. You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but you treat liquids as if they were solid surfaces. You can’t fall, and you remain hovering in the air even if stunned or otherwise incapacitated. You cannot talk or manipulate objects in storm cloud form, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be used, dropped, or interacted with in any way. You cannot cast spells while in this form. As an action, you can attack an opponent up to 30 feet away, dealing 3d8 lightning damage on a hit. You can also use an action to bring down rain upon a 5‐foot square within your reach, drenching it and putting out any nonmagical fires in that area. Finally, you can use an action to expand your form to encompass a 20‐foot‐radius area, unleashing the storm’s full fury in a burst of rain, wind, lightning, and thunder. Each creature in the area is drenched with rain, takes 3d8 lightning and 3d8 thunder damage, is deafened for 1d4 rounds, and is knocked prone. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the deafened and prone conditions. Taking this action uses up any remaining duration of the spell, and you resume your normal form at the end of your turn.
  <em>Greater Analyze Device</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 206) – You discover all mechanical properties, mechanisms, and functions of a single construct, clockwork device, mechanical trap, or magic item, including how to activate or deactivate those functions, if appropriate.
  <em>Greater Protective Nimbus</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 206) – You wrap yourself in a powerful corona that sheds bright light in a 30‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it, which creates a blast of light in a 30‐foot radius. The blast deals 4d8 radiant damage to each creature in the area while simultaneously healing yourself of an equal amount of damage.
  <em>Greater Seal Of Sanctuary</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 206) – You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 100 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 15d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage. Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 4d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn. Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 100 feet of the seal. The seal has AC 18, 75 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if the seal itself is reduced to 0 hit points.
  <em>Magnetize M</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 225) – You magnetize a large piece of metal or stone (such as a door, a stone pillar, or a 5‐foot‐square section of floor) that you touch, giving it a powerful attraction to ferrous metal. Any iron objects within 50 feet of the target that are not fastened down or being held or worn are pulled toward it, moving against or up to the target and remaining there. Any creature located between such an object and the magnet might be struck; roll a ranged spell attack against the target’s AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 damage of the appropriate type (bludgeoning for a hammer, slashing or piercing for a sword, and so forth).  Objects held by or in the possession of a creature are also attracted. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to retain a grip on any held or worn objects. On a successful save, the creature retains possession of the object, but is dragged 5 feet closer to the magnet.  A creature can voluntarily release a metal object in its possession and forgo a save.  Creatures garbed in mostly metal armor, or made of metal, are also attracted to the magnet, and have disadvantage on their saving throws to avoid being pulled toward it. If such a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it can move away from the magnet on its turn, but the area within 50 feet of the magnet is considered difficult terrain. If the creature is still in this area at the start of its next turn, it must make another successful saving throw to avoid being drawn toward the magnet. A creature that comes into contact with the magnet is restrained. It can negate this condition by using an action and succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC to remove itself from the magnet.
  <em>Maim</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 225) – Your hands become black claws bathed in necrotic energy. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage and a section of its body of your choosing withers: Upper Limb. The target has disadvantage on Strength ability checks, and, if it has the Multiattack action, it has disadvantage on its first attack roll each round. Lower Limb. The target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks. Body. Choose one damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The target loses its resistance to that damage type. If the target doesn’t have resistance to the chosen damage type, it is vulnerable to that damage type instead. The effect is permanent until removed by remove curse, greater restoration, or similar magic.
  <em>Malevolent Waves</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 225) – You create an invisible miasma that fills the area within 30 feet of you. All your allies have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks they make within 30 feet of you, and all your enemies are poisoned while within that radius.
  <em>Mammon's Avarice</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 225) – By casting this spell, you tap into the power of greed that is Mammon’s sphere of influence, which manifests as a heightened olfactory sense. You can pinpoint, by smell, the location of any precious metals or gemstones within 30 feet of you. If you find anything, you can use an action to determine the exact types and amounts of any such materials. If materials of this sort are completely enclosed by, or separated from you by, more than 6 feet of earth or wood, 2 feet of stone, or 2 inches of common metal, you cannot detect them even if they are in range.
  <em>Mammon's Due</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 225) – You summon a cylindrical sinkhole filled with burning ash and grasping arms made of molten metal at a point on the ground you can see within range. The sinkhole is 20 feet deep, 50 feet in diameter, and is difficult terrain. A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast, or that begins its turn in the area or enters it during its turn, takes  10d6 fire damage and must make a Strength or Dexterity (creature’s choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the molten arms, which try to drag it below the surface of the ash. A creature that’s restrained by the arms at the start of your turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet farther down into the ash. A creature pulled below the surface is blinded, deafened, and can’t breathe. To escape, a creature must use an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature is no longer restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again, but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in the ash pit at the start of its next turn. The diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically. As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for each hour that passes after the spell ends.
  <em>Heart-Seeking Arrow</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition—or the weapon itself, if it’s a thrown weapon—seeks its target’s vital organs. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 6d6 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon, or half as much damage on a miss, as it streaks unerringly toward its target. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target has disadvantage on its next death saving throw, and, if it dies, it can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
  <em>Heartstop</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – You slow the beating of a willing target’s heart to the rate of one beat per minute. The creature’s breathing almost stops. To a casual or brief observer, the subject appears dead. At the end of the spell, the creature returns to normal with no ill effects.
  <em>Heartstrike</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – The spirits of ancient archers carry your missiles straight to their targets. You have advantage on ranged weapon attacks until the start of your next turn, and you can ignore penalties for your enemies having half cover or three‐quarters cover and for an area being lightly obscured when making those attacks.
  <em>Heavenly Crown</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – A glowing, golden crown appears on your head and sheds dim light in a 30‐foot radius. When you cast the spell (and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, until the spell ends), you can target one willing creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. If the target can hear you, it can use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack and then move up to half its speed, or vice versa.
  <em>Hedren's Birds Of Clay</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – You create a number of clay pigeons equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one) that swirl around you. When you are the target of a ranged weapon attack or a ranged spell attack and before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to shout “Pull!” When you do, one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack. If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus, the attack misses. Otherwise, make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier and compare it to the attack roll. If your roll is higher, the attack is intercepted and has no effect. Regardless of whether the attack is intercepted, one clay pigeon is expended. The spell ends when the last clay pigeon is used.
  <em>Hematomancy</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 209) – You can learn information about a creature whose blood you possess. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target knows you’re casting the spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants you to learn the information. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, or if the blood belongs to a dead creature, you learn the following information: • The target’s most common name (if any). • The target’s creature type (and subtype, if any), gender, and which of its ability scores is highest (though not the exact numerical score). • The target’s current status (alive, dead, sick, wounded, healthy, etc.). • The circumstances of the target shedding the blood you’re holding (bleeding wound, splatter from an attack, how long ago it was shed, etc.). Alternatively, you can forgo all of the above information and instead use the blood as a beacon to track the target. For 1 hour, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the creature, you know the direction and distance to the target’s location at the time you cast this spell. While moving toward the location, if you are presented with a choice of paths, the spell automatically indicates which path provides the shortest and most direct route to the location.
  <em>Channel Fiendish Power</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 167) – You infuse yourself with dark power from the Lower Planes, which grants you magical gifts for a short time. While this spell is in effect, your body takes on minor fiendish characteristics: scales, a reddish or greenish hue to your skin, small horns protruding from your forehead, or other such features. While the spell is in effect, you gain two of the following abilities: • Darkvision with a range of 120 feet, unimpeded by magical darkness. • Immunity to fire damage. • Immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. • Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. • Resistance to one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. • Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from weapons that aren’t silvered. • Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. • Claws that grant you a melee weapon attack that deals 1d8 slashing damage. • Wings that grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
  <em>Chaotic Form</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 167) – You cause the form of a willing creature to become malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target’s will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid‐shaped ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target’s movement is halved while it is affected by chaotic form.
  <em>Chaotic Vitality</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 167) – Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1 round per caster level. For example, a 3rd‐level spellcaster who currently has 17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71 hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get 50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds.
  <em>Symbol Of Sorcery</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – You draw an arcane symbol on an object, wall, or other surface at least 5 feet wide. When a creature other than you approaches within 5 feet of the symbol, that act triggers an arcane explosion. Each creature in a 60‐foot cone must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be stunned. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After this symbol explodes or when the duration expires, its power is spent and the spell ends.
  <em>Targeting Foreknowledge</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – Twisting the knife, slapping with the butt of the spear, slashing out again as you recover from a lunge, and countless other double‐strike maneuvers are skillful ways to get more from your weapon. By casting this spell as a bonus action after making a successful melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type to the target. In addition, if your weapon attack roll was a 19 or higher, it is a critical hit and increases the weapon’s damage dice as normal. The extra damage from this spell is not increased on a critical hit.
  <em>Telekinetic Parry</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – As a reaction, you use a brief burst of kinetic energy to block an attack against you. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. An attack that hits deals damage as normal. This spell works against melee and ranged attacks, as well as spell attacks that have a physical manifestation, including force effects, but not against spells that do not require an attack roll, such as magic missile.
  <em>Telekinetic Trip</em> (Transmutation Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – You lash out with a burst of telekinesis, sweeping a creature within range off its feet. The target of this spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
  <em>Terrifying Lash</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – A faintly luminous whip of energy coalesces in your hand. The whip has reach, and you can take an action to make a melee attack roll against a target on your turn, using your
  <em>Obsidian Warstrike</em> (transmutation <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – You cause three parallel lines of thick, flared obsidian spikes to erupt from the ground. They appear within range on a solid surface, last for the duration, and provide three‐quarters cover to creatures behind them. You can make lines (up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick) or form a circle (20 feet in diameter, up to 15 feet high and 5 feet thick). When the lines appear, each creature in their area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures takes 8d8 slashing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature can move through the lines at the risk of cutting itself on the exposed edges. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the lines, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the lines on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d8 slashing damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. When you stop concentrating on the spell, you can cause the obsidian spikes to explode, dealing 5d8 slashing damage to any creature within 15 feet, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity save. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage from all effects of the lines increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.
  <em>Talons Of A Hungry</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 259) – You cause three parallel lines of thick, flared obsidian spikes to erupt from the ground. They appear within range on a solid surface, last for the duration, and provide three‐quarters cover to creatures behind them. You can make lines (up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick) or form a circle (20 feet in diameter, up to 15 feet high and 5 feet thick). When the lines appear, each creature in their area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures takes 8d8 slashing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature can move through the lines at the risk of cutting itself on the exposed edges. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the lines, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the lines on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d8 slashing damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. When you stop concentrating on the spell, you can cause the obsidian spikes to explode, dealing 5d8 slashing damage to any creature within 15 feet, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity save. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage from all effects of the lines increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.
  <em>Unruly Item</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 271) – You animate an object in the possession of a creature within range, giving the object limited movement and a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The effect of the spell varies depending on the kind of object you affect.  Weapon. A weapon being wielded by a creature fights and twists, trying to free itself from the creature’s grasp. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks it makes in that round with the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or more, the creature drops the weapon.  Armor. The creature’s armor shifts and moves, becoming noisy and uncomfortable. If the armor does not normally impart disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, it does so while this spell is in effect. The creature wearing it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take a 10‐foot penalty to its speed and be unable to use the Dash action.  Other Items. The effects on other carried items can vary at the GM’s discretion. A potion might behave as a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a random item each round on a failed save. 
  <em>Unseen Strangler</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 271) – You conjure an immaterial, tentacled aberration in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and you specify a password that the phantom recognizes. The entity remains where you conjured it until the spell ends, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 80 feet from it.  The strangler is invisible to all creatures except you, and it can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it without speaking the password that you specified, the strangler starts whispering your name. This whispering is always audible to you, regardless of other sounds in the area, as long as you’re conscious. The strangler sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.  If any creatures hostile to you are within 5 feet of the strangler at the start of your turn, the strangler attacks one of them with a tentacle. It makes a melee weapon attack with a bonus equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller creature is grappled (escape DC = your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the strangler can’t attack another target. If the strangler scores a critical hit, the target begins to suffocate and can’t speak until the grapple ends. 
  <em>Unshackled Magic</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 271) – You designate a creature within range that has the Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine what slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast that particular spell at that particular time.  Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled magic spell does not end. 
  <em>Soothing Chant</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 251) – Intoning a lulling drone, you convince creatures not to do you harm. At the beginning of its turn, any creature that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed. A creature charmed by soothing chant can still act aggressively toward your allies. If it uses area attacks, the creature will position them so as not to include you in the area. On a successful save, a creature can act against you normally, but it must make another saving throw in every round when you continue to chant, and it can hear you.  On your turn, you can use a bonus action to designate up to six other creatures that the charmed creatures will not attack.  The effects last for the duration or until you (or any other designated creatures) engage in hostile action against a charmed creature or in its presence.  Any creature that you attack or target with a harmful spell, or that sees you attack or cast a harmful spell against another charmed creature, is no longer affected by this spell and can act normally against you (or against any creature you designated).
  <em>Soothing Incandescence</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 251) – A soft, white radiance spreads out from a point just above your head, creating bright light in a 30-foot radius around your present location. If you move from your present location, the area of light remains fixed. A creature in the area other than a fiend or an undead regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns while within the bright light. Each fiend or undead in the area takes 2d4 radiant damage at the start of each of its turns.
  <em>Soul Borrowing</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 251) – By touching a creature, you gain one sense, movement mode and speed, feat, language, immunity, or other nonmagical ability of the target for the duration of the spell. The target also retains the use of the borrowed ability. An unwilling target prevents the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw. The target can be a living creature or one that has been dead no longer than 1 minute; a corpse automatically fails the saving throw. You can possess only one borrowed ability at a time.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, its duration increases to 1 hour and the target loses the stolen power for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Last Rays Of The Dying Sun</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 221) – A burst of searing heat explodes from you, dealing 6d6 fire damage to all enemies within range. Immediately afterward, a wave of frigid cold rolls across the same area, dealing 6d6 cold damage to enemies. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the damage from both waves increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
  <em>Laugh In The Face Of Fear</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 221) – You instill up to six creatures within range with the ability to laugh at something that would normally frighten them. An affected creature has advantage on saving throws against any spell or effect that causes the frightened condition. When a creature protected by this spell succeeds on such a saving throw, it can—if it has the mentality and capability to do so—laugh at the creature that caused the frightened condition. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of the one who laughed. The frightened condition lasts as long as that creature can see or hear the creature who laughed, or until the spell’s duration expires.
  <em>Lava Stone</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 221) – When you cast lava stone on a piece of sling ammo, the stone or bullet becomes intensely hot. As a bonus action, you can launch the heated stone with a sling: the stone increases in size and melts into a glob of lava while in flight. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage plus 6d6 fire damage. The target takes additional fire damage at the start of each of your next three turns, starting with 4d6, then 2d6, and then 1d6. The additional damage can be avoided if the target or an ally within 5 feet of the target scrapes off the lava. This is done by using an action to make a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spellcasting save DC. The spell ends if the heated sling stone isn’t used immediately.
  <em>Lay To Rest</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 221) – A pulse of searing light rushes out from you. Each undead creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. An undead creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell disintegrates in a burst of radiant motes, leaving anything it was wearing or carrying in the space it formerly occupied.
  <em>Legend Killer</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 221) – You tap into the life force of a creature that is capable of performing legendary actions. When you cast the spell, the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to take legendary actions for the spell’s duration. A creature can’t use legendary resistance to automatically succeed on the saving throw against this spell. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at  the end of each of its turns, regaining 1 legendary action on a successful save. The target continues repeating the saving throw until the spell ends or it regains all its legendary actions.
  <em>Mosquito Bane</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 229) – This spell kills any insects or swarms of insects within range that have a total of 25 hit points or fewer.
  <em>Mud Pack</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 229) – This spell covers you or a willing creature you touch in mud consistent with the surrounding terrain. For the duration, the spell protects the target from extreme cold and heat, allowing the target to automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws against environmental hazards related to temperature. In addition, the target has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while traveling at a slow pace in the terrain related to the component for this spell. If the target is subject to heavy precipitation for 1 minute, the precipitation removes the mud, ending the spell.
  <em>Nature's Aegis</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 229) – Grass, vines, branches, and other vegetation weave themselves over your body into a temporary suit of armor. You can use an action to dismiss this spell. Nature's aegis gives you an Armor Class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. The armor weighs 8 pounds and provides you with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in the terrain from which you used the vegetation.
  <em>Necrotic Leech</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 229) – You channel destructive energy through your touch. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. The target takes 8d10 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell slot you expended. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.
  <em>Nest Of Infernal Vipers</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 229) – You summon evil spirits that take the form of a swarm of poisonous snakes and appear in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The swarm of snakes is considered a fiend as well as a beast. It has resistance to fire damage and lasts until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends. The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the swarm, which takes its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the swarm, it moves to attack the nearest creature that is not your ally. The GM has the creature's statistics.
  <em>Recharge</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – You draw magical energy through yourself as a conduit to recharge a magic item. A single magic item that uses charges and that you are touching at the time of the casting immediately regains 1d3 charges. An item cannot receive more than its maximum number of charges, and any excess energy dissipates harmlessly, unless the item in question is capable of a retributive strike. If such an item is charged past its capacity, it explodes as if you had used an action to enact the retributive strike, with all the resulting effects.
  <em>Remove Scent</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – You magically remove strong odors from an area, person, or object. Up to a 40‐foot cube or a single creature or object of up to Large size can be affected. A room full of garbage or carrion ceases to smell, for example, or someone sprayed by a skunk no longer bears the odor. If there is still material producing odors in the area, however, the smell will return within an hour. If cast upon the area of a stinking cloud spell, it removes the odor and the spell’s nauseating qualities, but not the obscuring fog itself.  This spell can also be cast on a single creature of up to Large size, except for one that already gives off a strong odor (such as a troglodyte). For the next hour, the creature has no scent, and it cannot be detected by Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on scent.
  <em>Reposition</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – You designate up to three friendly creatures (one of which can be yourself) within range. Each target teleports to an unoccupied space of its choosing that it can see within 30 feet of itself.
  <em>Reset</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – Choose up to four creatures within range. If a target is your ally, it can reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results it prefers. If a target is your enemy, it must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results you prefer. Changes to the initiative order go into effect at the start of the next round.
  <em>Reverberate</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – You touch the ground at your feet with the metal ring, creating an impact that shakes the earth ahead of you. Creatures and unattended objects touching the ground in a 15‐foot cone emanating from you take 4d6 thunder damage, and creatures fall prone; a creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage and does not fall prone.
  <em>Revive Beast</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 239) – You touch a beast that has died within the last minute. That beast returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a beast that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.
  <em>Earworm Melody</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 190) – You sing or play a catchy tune that only one creature of your choice within range can hear. Unless the creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, the verse becomes ingrained in its head. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it must make a Constitution check with disadvantage against your spell save DC in order to maintain concentration. For the spell’s duration, the target takes 2d4 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns as the melody plays over and over in its mind. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the target must also repeat the Constitution check with disadvantage if it is concentrating on a spell. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Echoes Of Steel</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 190) – When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to cast echoes of steel. All creatures you designate within 30 feet of you take thunder damage equal to the damage from the melee attack, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
  <em>Ectoplasm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 190) – You call forth an ectoplasmic manifestation of Medium size that appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range that you can see. The manifestation lasts for the spell’s duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the manifestation takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. As a bonus action, you can move the manifestation up to 30 feet. It can move through a creature’s space but can’t remain in the same space as that creature. If it enters a creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn. When you move the manifestation, it can flow through a gap as small as 1 square inch, over barriers up to 5 feet tall, and across pits up to 10 feet wide. The manifestation sheds dim light in a 10‐foot radius. It also leaves a thin film of ectoplasmic residue on everything it touches or moves through. This residue doesn’t illuminate the surroundings but does glow dimly enough to show the manifestation’s path. The residue dissipates 1 round after it is deposited. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Eidetic Memory</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 190) – When you cast this spell, you can recall any piece of information you’ve ever read or heard in the past. This ability translates into a +10 bonus on Intelligence checks for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Eldritch Communion</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 190) – You contact a Great Old One and ask one question that can be answered with a one‐sentence reply no more than twenty words long. You must ask your question before the spell ends. There is a 25 percent chance that the answer contains a falsehood or is misleading in some way. (The GM determines this secretly.) Great Old Ones have vast knowledge, but they aren’t omniscient, so if your question pertains to information beyond the Old One’s knowledge, the answer might be vacuous, gibberish, or an angry, “I don’t know.” This also reveals the presence of all aberrations within 300 feet of you. There is a 1‐in‐6 chance that each aberration you become aware of also becomes aware of you. If you cast eldritch communion two or more times before taking a long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive no answer and become afflicted with short‐term madness.
  <em>Absorbing Field</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – You cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell has no effect on you and is absorbed by the field. You regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you. If you have no expended spell slots of that level, you don’t regain a spell slot, but this spell remains in effect. Even if the spell manages to bypass the field, you gain advantage on your saving throw.
  <em>Accelerate</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – Choose up to three willing creatures within range, which can include you. For the duration of the spell, each target’s walking speed is doubled. Each target can also use a bonus action on each of its turns to take the Dash action, and it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Acid Gate</em> (7th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – You create a portal of swirling, acidic green vapor in an unoccupied space you can see. This portal connects with a target destination within 100 miles that you are personally familiar with and have seen with your own eyes, such as your wizard’s tower or an inn you have stayed at. You and up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal and pass through it, arriving at the target destination (or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.
  <em>Acid Rain</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – You unleash a storm of swirling acid in a cylinder 20 feet wide and 30 feet high, centered on a point you can see. The area is heavily obscured by the driving acid fall. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 6d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes half as much damage from the acid (as if it had made a successful saving throw) at the start of its first turn after leaving the affected area. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Acumen</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Wisdom check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Adjust Position</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 141) – You adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical position. You move one willing creature within range 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional willing creature for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Weapon Of Blood</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 275) – When you cast this spell, you inflict 1d4 slashing damage on yourself that can’t be healed until after the blade created by this spell is destroyed or the spell ends. The trickling blood transforms into a dagger of red metal that functions as a +1 dagger.
  <em>Weiler's Ward</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 275) – You create four small orbs of faerie magic that float around your head and give off dim light out to a radius of 15 feet. Whenever a Large or smaller enemy enters that area of dim light, or starts its turn in the area, you can use your reaction to attack it with one or more of the orbs. The enemy creature makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet directly away from you, and each orb you used in the attack explodes violently, dealing 1d6 force damage to the creature.
  <em>Wild Shield</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 275) – You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible. While wild shield is active, you can use a reaction to repel a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any effect of the surge. Wild shield ends when the duration expires or when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to repel a spell whose level exceeds the number of levels remaining, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of levels wild shield can still repel. If the check succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether the spell is repelled.
  <em>Wild Trajectory</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 275) – You create a 30‐foot cube of magical instability that causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or tangible manifestation (such as fireball, lightning bolt, or a ray or projectile such as magic missile or ray of frost) passes through the area, roll a d8. On a 1, the spell continues on its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a 5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45 degrees to the left; on a 7, it diverts 90 degrees to the left; on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left. A spell that affects anything in its path, such as lightning bolt, continues to do so along its new trajectory, up to the limit of its range. A fireball spell will travel in the new direction up to the limit of its range before detonating. A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it encounters along its new trajectory.
  <em>Wind Lash</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 275) – Your swift gesture creates a solid lash of howling wind. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage from the shearing wind and is pushed 5 feet away from you. The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
  <em>Auspicious Warning</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 151) – Just in time, you call out a fortunate warning to a creature within range. The target rolls a d4 and adds the number rolled to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that it has just made and uses the new result for determining success or failure.
  <em>Avoid Grievous Injury</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 151) – You cast this spell when a foe strikes you with a critical hit but before damage dice are rolled. The critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
  <em>Avronin's Astral Assembly</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 151) – You alert a number of creatures that you are familiar with, up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1), of your intent to communicate with them through spiritual projection. The invitation can extend any distance and even cross to other planes of existence. Once notified, the creatures can choose to accept this communication at any time during the duration of the spell. When a creature accepts, its spirit is projected into one of the gems used in casting the spell. The material body it leaves behind falls unconscious and doesn’t need food or air. The creature’s consciousness is present in the room with you, and its normal form appears as an astral projection within 5 feet of the gem its spirit occupies. You can see and hear all the creatures who have joined in the assembly, and they can see and hear you and each other as if they were present (which they are, astrally). They can’t interact with anything physically. A creature can end the spell’s effect on itself voluntarily at any time, as can you. When the effect ends or the duration expires, a creature’s spirit returns to its body, and it regains consciousness. A creature that withdraws voluntarily from the assembly can’t rejoin it even if the spell is still active. If a gem is broken while occupied by a creature’s astral self, the spirit in the gem returns to its body and the creature suffers two levels of exhaustion.
  <em>Awakened Objects</em> ( <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg ) – An awakened object needs no air, food, water, or sleep. Damage to an awakened object can be healed or mechanically repaired.
  <em>Awaken Object</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 151) – After spending the casting time enchanting a ruby along with a Large or smaller nonmagical object in humanoid form, you touch the ruby to the object. The ruby dissolves into the object, which becomes a living construct imbued with sentience. If the object has no face, a humanoid face appears on it in an appropriate location. The awakened object’s statistics are determined by its size, as shown on the table below. An awakened object can use an action to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet of it. It has free will, acts independently, and speaks one language you know. It is initially friendly to anyone who assisted in its creation.An awakened object’s speed is 30 feet. If it has no apparent legs or other means of moving, it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and it can hover. Its sight and hearing are equivalent to a typical human’s senses. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the GM to fit unusual circumstances. A beautiful statue might awaken with increased Charisma, for example, or the bust of a great philosopher could have surprisingly high Wisdom.
  <em>Disquieting Gaze</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – Your eyes burn with scintillating motes of unholy crimson light. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against creatures that can see you, and you have advantage on spell attack rolls that deal necrotic damage to creatures that can see your eyes.
  <em>Disruptive Aura</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – A warping, prismatic aura surrounds and outlines each creature inside a 10‐foot cube within range. The aura sheds dim light out to 10 feet, and the locations of hidden or invisible creatures are outlined. If a creature in the area tries to cast a spell or use a magic item, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell or item functions normally. On a failed save, the effect of the spell or the item is suppressed for the duration of the aura. Time spent suppressed counts against the duration of the spell’s or item’s effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 9th‐level spell slot, the cube is 20 feet on a side.
  <em>Distracting Divination</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – Foresight tells you when and how to be just distracting enough to foil an enemy spellcaster. When an adjacent enemy tries to cast a spell, make a melee spell attack against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy’s spell fails and has no effect; the enemy’s action is used up, but the spell slot isn’t expended.
  <em>Distraction Cascade</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – With a flash of foresight, you throw a foe off balance. Choose one creature you can see that your ally has just declared as the target of an attack. Unless that creature makes a successful Charisma saving throw, attacks against it are made with advantage until the end of this turn.
  <em>Distressing Resonance</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – You create a field of subsonic vibrations in a 30‐foot‐ radius sphere, centered on a point you choose within range, which causes physical distress and extreme discomfort. A creature in this area or that enters it after you cast the spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the beginning of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can act normally. If a creature begins its turn in the area, it must make another successful save to avoid being incapacitated. Constructs, deafened creatures, oozes, plants, and undead are not affected by this spell. The vibrations from the distressing resonance interfere with tremorsense, negating any use of that ability in the spell’s area.
  <em>Dome Of Silence</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 186) – An invisible dome encompasses a 10‐foot‐radius around you, creating a damper for any sound traveling into or out of the area. Creatures can pass through the dome normally, but sound does not. You and any creatures in the dome can hear one another, but nothing outside. Likewise, any noise made in the dome of silence cannot be heard outside it. Any attack that deals thunder damage dispels the dome, but the dome reduces that damage to any creatures inside it by half.
  <em>Delayed Healing</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – Touch a living creature (not a construct or undead) as you cast the spell. The next time that creature takes damage, it immediately regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).
  <em>Demon Within</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – One humanoid of your choice within range becomes a gateway for a demon to enter the plane of existence you are on. You choose the demon’s type from among those of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 force damage from the demon’s attempt to claw its way through the gate. For the spell’s duration, you can use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an additional 2d6 force damage to the target each time. If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in the same space as its now incapacitated or dead victim. You do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.
  <em>Desiccating Breath</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – You spew forth a cloud of black dust that draws all moisture from a 30‐foot cone. Each animal in the cone takes 4d10 necrotic damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. The damage is 6d10 for plants and plant creatures, also halved on a successful Constitution saving throw.
  <em>Detect Dragons</em> (2 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – You can detect the presence of dragons and other draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120 feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover depends on the number of consecutive rounds you spend an action studying a subject or area. On the first round of examination, you detect whether any draconic creatures are present, but not their number, location, identity, or type. On the second round, you learn the number of such creatures as well as the general condition of the most powerful one. On the third and subsequent rounds, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds, you learn the age, type, and location of one draconic creature. Note that the spell provides no information on the turn in which it is cast, unless you have the means to take a second action that turn.
  <em>Deva's Wings</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – You touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery white wings that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet and the ability to hover. When the target takes the Attack action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone. When the spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it was aloft.
  <em>Discern Weakness</em> (2 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 185) – You divine the weak points in your foes’ defenses, allowing you to strike with deadly effect. If you score a critical hit or a successful sneak attack on an opponent, roll damage twice and take the better result.
  <em>Babble</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 152) – This spell causes the speech of affected creatures to sound like nonsense. Each creature in a 30‐foot‐radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected creature cannot communicate in any spoken language that it knows. When it speaks, the words come out as gibberish. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast. The spell does not affect telepathic communication, nonverbal communication, or sounds emitted by any creature that does not have a spoken language. As an action, a creature under the effect of this spell can attempt another Intelligence saving throw against the effect. On a successful save, the spell ends.
  <em>Bad Timing</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 152) – You point toward a creature that you can see and twist strands of chaotic energy around its fate. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving throw, the next attack roll or ability check the creature attempts within 10 minutes is made with disadvantage.
  <em>Batsense</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 152) – For the duration of the spell, a creature you touch can produce and interpret squeaking sounds used for echolocation, giving it blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. The target cannot use its blindsight while deafened, and its blindsight doesn’t penetrate areas of magical silence. While using blindsight, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on being silent. Additionally, the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
  <em>Battle Mind</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 152) – You gain a preternatural sense of the surrounding area, allowing you insights you can share with comrades to provide them with an edge in combat. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made when determining surprise at the beginning of a combat encounter. If you are not surprised, then neither are your allies. When you are engaged in combat while the spell is active, you can use a bonus action on your turn to produce one of the following effects (allies must be able to see or hear you in order to benefit): • One ally gains advantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. • An enemy has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you or an ally. • You divine the location of an invisible or hidden creature and impart that knowledge to any allies who can see or hear you. This knowledge does not negate any advantages the creature has, it only allows your allies to be aware of its location at the time. If the creature moves after being detected, its new location is not imparted to your allies. • Three allies who can see and hear you on your turn are given the benefit of a bless, guidance, or resistance spell on their turns; you choose the benefit individually for each ally. An ally must use the benefit on its turn, or the benefit is lost.
  <em>Beguiling Bet</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 152) – You issue a challenge against one creature you can see within range, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. On a failed save, you can make an ability check as a bonus action. For example, you could make a Strength (Athletics) check to climb a difficult surface or to jump as high as possible; you could make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to perform a backflip; or you could make a Charisma (Performance) check to sing a high note or to extemporize a clever rhyme. You can choose to use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of the usual ability modifier for this check, and you add your proficiency bonus if you’re proficient in the skill being used. The charmed creature must use its next action (which can be a legendary action) to make the same ability check in a contest against your check. Even if the creature can’t perform the action—it may not be close enough to a wall to climb it, or it might not have appendages suitable for strumming a lute—it must still attempt the action to the best of its capability. If you win the contest, the spell (and the contest) continues, with you making a new ability check as a bonus action on your turn. The spell ends when it expires or when the creature wins the contest. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd. Each creature must be within 30 feet of another creature when you cast the spell.
  <em>Wind Of The Hereafter</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 276) – You create a 30‐foot‐radius sphere of roiling wind that carries the choking stench of death. The sphere is centered on a point you choose within range. The wind blows around corners. When a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it takes 8d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.  The sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, drifting along the surface of the ground. It is not heavier than air but drifts in a straight line for the duration of the spell, even if that carries it over a cliff or gully. If the sphere meets a wall or other impassable obstacle, it turns to the left or right (select randomly).
  <em>Wind Tunnel</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 276) – You create a swirling tunnel of strong wind extending from yourself in a direction you choose. The tunnel is a line 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. The wind blows from you toward the end of the line, which is stationary once created. A creature in the line moving with the wind (away from you) adds 10 feet to its speed, and ranged weapon attacks launched with the wind don’t have disadvantage because of long range. Creatures in the line moving against the wind (toward you) spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move, and ranged weapon attacks launched along the line against the wind are made with disadvantage.  The wind tunnel immediately disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the line. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance of extinguishing them.
  <em>Winter's Radiance</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 276) – When you cast this spell, the piercing rays of a day’s worth of sunlight reflecting off fresh snow blankets the area, and the temperature drops precipitously. A creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 cold damage and being blinded for the duration on a failed save or half as much damage with no additional effect on a successful one. Creatures possessing Sunlight Sensitivity have disadvantage on their save.  If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 6th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
  <em>Winterdark</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 276) – This spell invokes the deepest part of night on the winter solstice. You target a 40‐foot‐radius, 60‐foothigh cylinder centered on a point within range, which is plunged into darkness and unbearable cold. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of its turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold damage are also immune to the exhaustion effect, as are creatures wearing cold weather gear or otherwise adapted for a cold environment.  As a bonus action, you can move the center of the effect 20 feet.
  <em>Wintry Glide</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 276) – Upon casting wintry glide, you can travel via ice or snow without crossing the intervening space. If you are adjacent to a mass of ice or snow, you can enter it by expending 5 feet of movement. By expending another 5 feet of movement, you can immediately exit from that mass at any point—within 500 feet—that’s part of the contiguous mass of ice or snow. When you enter the ice or snow, you instantly know the extent of the material within 500 feet.  You must have at least 10 feet of movement available when you cast the spell, or it fails. If the mass of ice or snow is destroyed while you are transiting it, you must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage and falling prone at the midpoint of a line between your entrance point and your intended exit point.
  <em>Abhorrence</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – You temporarily make a creature within range less appealing to others. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell. On a successful save, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Charisma check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Abhorrent Apparition</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Ears Of The Bat</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 189) – You gain the keen hearing and echolocation abilities of a bat. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, and you gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. You cannot use the blindsight ability while deafened. While the spell is in effect, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal thunder damage.
  <em>Earth Wave</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 189) – You command the earth beneath your feet to rise and surge forward, carrying you and your companions where you bid while rolling over enemies and obstacles in your path. The earth rises in a 15‐foot‐high, 15‐foot‐radius swell that can carry you and up to eight other Medium creatures, propelling you in whatever direction you choose at a rate of up to 90 feet per round. You use a bonus action to direct the wave each round. Your movement is limited to the surface of the wave to maintain control. If you move off the wave, it continues on the same course you directed it, then the spell ends at the beginning of your next turn. Natural obstacles do not impede the spell’s movement; trees, rocks, and other natural obstacles simply rise up and around the swell and settle back into place behind it. The wave can travel up or down natural slopes with angles as great as 60 degrees. You can direct the wave to surge over man‐made obstacles and creatures in its path. The swell washes over walls and other manufactured obstacles up to 15 feet high and 10 feet thick with no loss of movement, dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to an object as it passes. Resolve this damage against larger, rigid objects, such as walls, vehicles, or other similar structures; smaller or malleable objects such as unsecured ropes or cloth are simply buried by the swell’s passing. Larger objects are subject to the damage, but the wave cannot move over them unless the damage is enough to destroy the object. Creatures of Large size or smaller in the path of the wave take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are buried. Buried creatures are considered restrained and must hold their breath or begin to suffocate. A creature in the path of the wave can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and avoids being buried. Each round, a buried creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to dig itself out. You can cast earth wave only when standing on natural earth or stone. The spell can be cast underground, but not inside buildings unless they have no floor.
  <em>Earthskimmer</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 189) – You cause earth and stone to rise up beneath your feet, lifting you up to 5 feet. For the duration, you can use your movement to cause the slab to skim along the ground or other solid, horizontal surface at a speed of 60 feet. This movement ignores difficult terrain. If you are pushed or moved against your will by any means other than teleporting, the slab moves with you. Until the end of your turn, you can enter the space of a creature up to one size larger than yourself when you take the Dash action. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or it takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone on a successful one.
  <em>Right The Stars</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 240) – You subtly warp the flow of space and time to enhance your conjurations with cosmic potency. Until the spell ends, the maximum duration of any conjuration spell you cast that requires concentration is doubled, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points, and y
  <em>Ring Strike</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 240) – You infuse two metal rings with magic, causing them to revolve in a slow orbit around your head or hand. For the duration, when you hit a target within 60 feet of you with an attack, you can launch one of the rings to strike the target as well. The target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on
  <em>Ring Ward</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 240) – The iron ring you use to cast the spell becomes a faintly shimmering circlet of energy that spins slowly around you at a radius of 15 feet. For the duration, you and your allies inside the protected area have advantage on saving throws against spells, and all affected creatures gain resistance to one type of
  <em>Riptide</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 240) – With a sweeping gesture, you cause water to swell up into a 20‐foot tall, 20‐foot radius cylinder centered on a point on the ground that you can see. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and suspended in the cylinder; on a successful s
  <em>Roaming Pain</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 240) – You afflict a single humanoid within range with severe pain in a random part of its body. Roll a d6 and consult the table to determine the spell’s initial effect. d6 Body Part Effect 1 3 5 Head Incapacitated Chest Cannot take reactions or bonus actions Arm Disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength and Dexte
  <em>Night Terrors</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – You amplify the fear that lurks in the heart of all creatures. Select a target point you can see within the spell’s range. Every creature within 20 feet of that point becomes frightened until the start of your next turn and must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to being frightened are not affected by night terrors.
  <em>Nightfall</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – You call upon night to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30‐foot‐radius cylinder of night centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is normal darkness, and thus heavily obscured. Creatures inside the darkened cylinder can see illuminated areas outside the cylinder normally.
  <em>Nimbleness</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – You touch a willing subject. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Dexterity check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Nip At The Heels</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – You create an illusory pack of wild dogs that bark and nip at one creature you can see within range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration as it is distracted by the dogs. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A target that is at least 10 feet off the ground (in a tree, flying, and so forth) has advantage on the saving throw, staying just out of reach of the jumping and barking dogs. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Not Dead Yet</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – You cast this spell while touching the cloth doll against the intact corpse of a Medium or smaller humanoid that died within the last hour. At the end of the casting, the body reanimates as an undead creature under your control. While the spell lasts, your consciousness resides in the animated body. You can use an action to manipulate the body’s limbs in order to make it move, and you can see and hear through the body’s eyes and ears, but your own body becomes unconscious. The animated body can neither attack nor defend itself. This spell doesn’t change the appearance of the corpse, so further measures might be needed if the body is to be used in a way that involves fooling observers into believing it’s still alive. The spell ends instantly, and your consciousness returns to your body, if either your real body or the animated body takes any damage. You can’t use any of the target’s abilities except for nonmagical movement and darkvision. You don’t have access to its knowledge, proficiencies, or anything else that was held in its now dead mind, and you can’t make it speak.
  <em>Not This Day!</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 230) – The creature you touch gains protection against either a specific damage type (slashing, poison, fire, radiant, and the like) or a category of creature (giant, beast, elemental, monstrosity, and so forth) that you name when the spell is cast. For the next 24 hours, the target has advantage on saving throws involving that type of damage or kind of creature, including death saving throws if the attack that dropped the target to 0 hit points is affected by this spell.  A character can be under the effect of only a single not this day! spell at one time; a second casting on the same target cancels the preexisting protection.
  <em>Legion Of Rabid Squirrels</em> (3rd-Level Conjuration <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 222) – While in a forest, you call a legion of rabid squirrels to descend from the nearby trees at a point you can see within range. The squirrels form into a swarm that uses the statistics of a swarm of poisonous snakes, except it has a climbing speed of 30 feet rather than a swimming speed. The legion of squirrels is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the legion, which has its own turns. The legion of squirrels obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the legion, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If you command it to move farther than 60 feet from you, the spell ends and the legion disperses back into the forest. A canid, such as a dog, wolf, fox, or worg, has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than the legion of rabid squirrels while the swarm is within 60 feet of the creature. When the spell ends, the squirrels disperse back into the forest.
  <em>Liar's Gift</em> (1st-Level Enchantment <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 222) – Liar’s gift makes even the most barefaced untruth seem plausible: you gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to convince another creature of the truth of whatever you’re saying. On a failed check, the creature knows that you tried to manipulate it with magic. If you successfully lie to a creature that has a friendly attitude toward you, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you can also coax the creature to reveal a potentially embarrassing secret. The verbal component of this spell is the lie you are telling.
  <em>Life From Death</em> (3rd-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 222) – The touch of your hand can siphon energy from the undead to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against an undead creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 radiant damage, and you or an ally within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the amount of radiant damage dealt. If used on an ally, this effect can restore the ally to no more than half of its hit point maximum. This effect can’t heal an undead or a construct. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
  <em>Life Hack</em> (8th-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 222) – Choose up to five creatures that you can see within range. Each of the creatures gains access to a pool of temporary hit points that it can draw upon over the spell’s duration or until the pool is used up. The pool contains 120 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points each individual creature can draw is determined by dividing 120 by the number of creatures with access to the pool. Hit points are drawn as a bonus action by the creature gaining the temporary hit points. Any number can be drawn at once, up to the maximum allowed. A creature can’t draw temporary hit points from the pool while it has temporary hit points from any source, including a previous casting of this spell.
  <em>Life Sense</em> (3rd-Level Divination <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 222) – For the duration, you can sense the location of any creature that isn’t a construct or an undead within 30 feet of you, regardless of impediments to your other senses. This spell doesn’t sense creatures that are dead. A creature trying to hide its life force from you can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, you can’t sense the creature with this casting of the spell. If you cast the spell again, the creature must make the saving throw again to remain hidden from your senses.
  <em>Abhorrent Apparition</em> (4th-level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 279) – You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
  <em>Speak With Inanimate Object</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 252) – You awaken a spirit that resides inside an inanimate object such as a rock, a sign, or a table, and can ask it up to three yes‐or‐no questions. The spirit is indifferent toward you unless you have done something to harm or help it. The spirit can give you information about its environment and about things it has observed (with its limited senses), and it can act as a spy for you in certain situations. The spell ends when its duration expires or after you have received answers to three questions.
  <em>Spectral Herd</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 252) – You summon a spectral herd of ponies to drag off a creature that you can see within range. The target must be Large or smaller. If it gets a failure on a Dexterity saving throw, a spectral rope wraps around the target, which falls prone and is restrained. It is immediately pulled 60 feet behind the galloping herd, in a direction of your choosing. The target also takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage from being dragged across the ground. While the target is restrained in this way, it is dragged another 60 feet and takes another 3d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns. The ponies continue running in the chosen direction for the duration of the spell. Once the direction is chosen, you can’t change it, but the ponies do swerve around impassable obstacles. They ignore difficult terrain and are immune to damage. The restrained creature can escape by using its action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell DC. The spectral rope can’t be severed. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, one additional creature can be targeted for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Spin</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 252) – You designate a creature you can see within range and tell it to spin. The creature can resist this command with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spins in place for the duration of the spell. A spinning creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that has spun for 1 round or longer becomes dizzy and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until 1 round after it stops spinning.
  <em>Spinning Axes</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 252) – Spinning axes made of luminous force burst out from you to strike all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each of those creatures takes 5d8 force damage, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures damaged by this spell that aren’t undead or constructs begin bleeding. A bleeding creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. A creature can stop the bleeding for itself or another creature by using an action to make a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC or by applying any amount of magical healing. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Spiteful Weapon</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 252) – You create a connection between the target of the spell, an attacker that injured the target during the last 24 hours, and the melee weapon that caused the injury, all of which must be within range when the spell is cast. For the duration of the spell, whenever the attacker takes damage while holding the weapon, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the same amount and type of damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The attacker can use the weapon on itself and thus cause the target to take identical damage. A self‐inflicted wound hits automatically, but damage is still rolled randomly. Once the connection is established, it lasts for the duration of the spell regardless of range, so long as all three elements remain on the same plane. The spell ends immediately if the attacker receives any healing. At Higher Levels. The target has disadvantage on its Charisma saving throws if spiteful weapon is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher.
  <em>Visage Of Madness</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 4th-Level Enchantment) – Your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that’s within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to 1d6 + the creature’s Strength modifier. The creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn and blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the d6) is blinded permanently.
  <em>Visage Of The Dead</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 4th-Level Necromancy (Ritual)) – You infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch, with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead. The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition for the duration of the spell, and they take on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves. Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the target for another undead creature. Typically this means the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent undead might depend on the conditions under which the encounter occurs, but if the target’s presence would not be unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it acts suspiciously.
  <em>Vital Mark</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 3rd-Level Transmutation (Ritual)) – You mark an unattended magic item (including weapons and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The item’s magical abilities don’t function for anyone else as long as the bloodstain remains on it. For example, a +1 flaming longsword with a vital mark functions as a nonmagical longsword in the hands of anyone but the caster, but it still functions as a +1 flaming longsword for the caster who placed the bloodstain on it. A wand of magic missiles would be no more than a stick in the hands of anyone but the caster. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher on the same item for 28 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent until dispelled.
  <em>Volley Shield</em> (7th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 7th-Level Abjuration) – You touch a willing creature and create a shimmering shield of energy to protect it. The shield grants the target a +5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration of the spell. In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back at their casters. When the target makes a successful saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell immediately becomes the spell’s new target. The caster is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it came from a spellcaster of the caster’s level.
  <em>Vomit Tentacles</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 2nd-Level Transmutation) – Your jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier and is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and it takes the same damage at the start of each of your turns. You can grapple only one creature at a time. The Armor Class of the tentacles is equal to yours. If they take slashing damage equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed to enable a grappled creature to escape. Severed tentacles are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage dealt to the tentacles doesn’t affect your hit points. While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech and can’t cast spells that have verbal components.
  <em>Voorish Sign</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 1st-Level Divination) – For the duration, invisible creatures and objects within 20 feet of you become visible to you, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened c condition. The effect moves with you, remaining centered on you until the duration expires. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.
  <em>Thin The Ice</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 260) – You target a point within range. That point becomes the top center of a cylinder 10 feet in radius and 40 feet deep. All ice inside that area melts immediately. The uppermost layer of ice seems to remain intact and sturdy, but it covers a 40‐foot‐deep pit filled with ice water. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check or passive Perception check against your spell save DC notices the thin ice. If a creature weighing more than 20 pounds (or a greater weight specified by you when casting the spell) treads over the cylinder or is already standing on it, the ice gives way. Unless the creature makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it falls into the icy water, taking 2d6 cold damage plus whatever other problems are caused by water, by armor, or by being drenched in a freezing environment. The water gradually refreezes normally.
  <em>Thorn Cage</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 260) – Thick vines studded with sharp thorns spring from the ground around a target of your choice. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the thorny vines until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the vines can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. Doing so causes the creature to take 2d6 piercing damage from the thorns. On a successful check, it frees itself.
  <em>Thousand Darts</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 260) – You launch thousands of needlelike darts in a 5‐foot‐wide line that is 120 feet long. Each creature in the line takes 6d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. The first creature struck by the darts makes the saving throw with disadvantage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Throes Of Ecstasy</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 260) – Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become overcome with euphoria, rendering it incapacitated for the duration. The target automatically fails Wisdom saving throws, and attack rolls against the target have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on the target, and it gains one level of exhaustion. If the spell continues for its maximum duration, the target gains three levels of exhaustion when the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 3rd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Abhorrent Apparition</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 4th-level) – You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  <em>Harrying Hounds</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – When you cast this spell, choose a direction (north, south, northeast, or the like). Each creature in a 20‐foot‐radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast pace in the opposite direction of the one you chose, as it believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen direction. When an affected creature isn’t traveling, it is frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead pacing half‐circles around the destination until the effect ends, terrified that the pack will overcome it if it stops moving. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each 4‐hour period, ending the effect on itself on a success. An affected creature moves along the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can’t safely move in the opposite direction from your chosen direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. In such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. The spell’s effect is suspended when an affected creature is engaged in combat, enabling it to move as necessary to face hostile creatures. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4 hours for each slot level above 5th. If an affected creature travels for more than 8 hours, it risks exhaustion as if on a forced march.
  <em>Harsh Light Of Summer's Glare</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – You emit a burst of brilliant light, which bears down oppressively upon all creatures within range that can see you. Creatures with darkvision that fail a Constitution saving throw are blinded and stunned. Creatures without darkvision that fail a Constitution saving throw are blinded. This is not a gaze attack, and it cannot be avoided by averting one’s eyes or wearing a blindfold.
  <em>Heart To Heart</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – For the duration, you and the creature you touch remain stable and unconscious if one of you is reduced to 0 hit points while the other has 1 or more hit points. If you touch a dying creature, it becomes stable but remains unconscious while it has 0 hit points. If both of you are reduced to 0 hit points, you must both make death saving throws, as normal. If you or the target regain hit points, either of you can choose to split those hit points between the two of you if both of you are within 60 feet of each other.
  <em>Heartache</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 208) – You force an enemy to experience pangs of unrequited love and emotional distress. These feelings manifest with such intensity that the creature takes 5d6 psychic damage on a failed Charisma saving throw, or half the damage on a successful save. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an additional enemy for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Going In Circles</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 205) – You make natural terrain in a 1‐mile cube difficult to traverse. A creature in the affected area has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks or travel safely through the area, as paths through the terrain seem to twist and turn nonsensically. The terrain itself isn’t changed, only the perception of those inside it. A creature that succeeds on two Wisdom (Survival) checks while in the terrain discerns the illusion for what it is and sees the illusory twists and turns superimposed on the terrain. A creature that reenters the area after exiting it before the spell ends is affected by the spell even if it previously succeeded in traversing the terrain. A creature with truesight can see through the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. A creature that casts find the path automatically succeeds in discovering a way out of the terrain. When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the word as it enters the area automatically sees the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. If you cast this spell on the same spot every day for one year, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
  <em>Gordolay's Pleasant Aroma</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 205) – You create an intoxicating aroma that fills the area within 30 feet of a point you can see within range. Creatures in this area smell something they find so pleasing that it’s distracting. Each creature in the area that makes an attack roll must first make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the attack is made with disadvantage. Only a creature’s first attack in a round is affected this way; subsequent attacks are resolved normally. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to the effect of this particular scent, but they can be affected again by a new casting of the spell.
  <em>Grain Of Truth</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 205) – You gain a bit of supernatural insight or advice. The first Intelligence or Charisma ability check you make within 1 minute is made with advantage, and you can include twice your proficiency bonus. At the GM’s discretion, this spell can instead provide a piece of general advice equivalent to the benefit of an augury spell. At Higher Levels. At the GM’s discretion, casting grain of truth using a 4th‐level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to a divination spell; a 5th‐level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to a single answer from a commune spell; and a 6th‐level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to three answers from a contact other plane spell.
  <em>Grasp Of The Tupilak</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 205) – This spell functions only against an arcane or divine spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that attack, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage and one or more of the victim’s available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower‐level slots. For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th‐level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might receive a 3rd‐level slot and a 2nd‐level slot, or a 3rd‐level slot and two 1st‐level slots if no 2nd‐level slot is available. If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st‐ and 2nd‐level spell slots—then grasp of the tupilak has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you’re able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use. Unused stolen spell slots disappear, returning whence they came, when you take a long rest or when the creature you stole them from receives the benefit of remove curse, greater restoration, or comparable magic.
  <em>Mantle Of The Brave</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 226) – You touch up to four individuals, bolstering their courage. The next time a creature affected by this spell must make a saving throw against a spell or effect that would cause the frightened condition, it has advantage on the roll. Once a creature has received this benefit, the spell ends for that creature.
  <em>Mark Prey</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 226) – You choose a creature you can see within range as your prey. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to find or track your prey. In addition, the target is outlined in light that only you can see. Any attack roll you make against your prey has advantage if you can see it, and your prey can’t benefit from being invisible against you. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new target as your prey. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
  <em>Mass Hobble Mount</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 226) – When you cast mass hobble mount, you make separate ranged spell attacks against up to six horses, wolves, or other four‐legged or two‐legged beasts being ridden as mounts within 60 feet of you. The targets can be different types of beasts and can have different numbers of legs. Each beast hit by your spell is disabled so that it can’t move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed in a turn takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
  <em>Mass Surge Dampener</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 226) – Using your strength of will, you protect up to three creatures other than yourself from the effect of a chaos magic surge. A protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once a protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by mass surge dampener, the spell’s effect ends for that creature.
  <em>Maw Of Needles</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 226) – A spiny array of needle‐like fangs protrudes from your gums, giving you a spiny bite. For the duration, you can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the bite. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or some of the spines in your mouth break off, sticking in the target. Until this spell ends, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 1d6 piercing damage from the spines. If you hit a target that has your spines stuck in it, your attack deals extra damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and more spines don’t break off in the target. Your spines can stick in only one target at a time. If your spines stick into another target, the spines on the previous target crumble to dust, ending the effect on that target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the spiny bite and the spines increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.
  <em>Storm God's Doom</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 256) – A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes with a low roar into vortex of air. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of the cylinder, and is thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a creature hits a solid obstruction when it’s thrown upward (such as a stone ceiling), it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 50 feet, minus the distance it traveled upward. For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only 10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 40 feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
  <em>Storm Of Wings</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 256) – You create a storm of spectral birds, bats, or flying insects in a 15-foot-radius sphere on a point you can see within range. The storm spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the storm when it appears and each a creature that starts its turn in the storm is affected by the storm. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the storm up to 30 feet. As an action on your turn, you can change the storm from one type to another, such as from a storm of bats to a storm of insects. Bats. The creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage, and its speed is halved while within the storm as the bats cling to it and drain its blood. Birds. The creature takes 4d6 slashing damage, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls while within the storm as the birds fly in the way of the creature’s attacks. Insects. The creature takes 4d6 poison damage, and it must make a Constitution saving throw each time it casts a spell while within the storm. On a failed save, the creature fails to cast the spell, losing the action but not the spell slot.
  <em>Strength Of An Ox</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 256) – You touch a creature and give it the capacity to carry, push, drag, or lift weight as if it were one size category larger for the duration of the spell. The target is also not subject to the penalties given in the variant rules for encumbrance. The subject can also carry a load that would normally be unwieldy, such as a large log, a rowboat, or an oxcart. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Sudden Dawn</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 256) – You call upon morning to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of light centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is brightly lit.
  <em>Sudden Stampede</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 256) – You conjure up a multitude of fey spirits that manifest as galloping horses. These horses run in a 10-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line, in a given direction starting from a point within range, trampling all creatures in their path, before vanishing again. Each creature in the line takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half, and the creature is not knocked prone.
  <em>Circle Of Wind</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 170) – Light wind encircles you, leaving you in the center of a mild vortex. For the duration, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC against ranged attacks. You also have advantage on saving throws against extreme environmental heat and against harmful gases, vapors, and inhaled poisons.
  <em>Claim Lair</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 170) – By placing your personal wealth within an area and invoking the dragon’s territorial nature, you claim the area as your lair, imbuing you with extra power within its confines. You can claim an area of up to 2,500 square feet (a space 50 feet square, or one hundred 5‐foot squares, or twenty‐five 10‐foot squares). The claimed area can be up to 20 feet tall and shaped as you desire. While within these confines, you can take one of the following lair actions once per round on initiative count 20: • Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within 30 feet, filling a 15‐foot‐radius sphere until you dismiss it as an action, use this lair action again, or die. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it, but you can see in the area as if it were brightly lit. If any of the effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. • Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. A buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state with a success. • A tremor shakes the lair in a 30‐foot radius around you. Each creature on the ground in that area other than you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone. You can take an action to dismiss this spell.
  <em>Clash Of Glaciers</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 170) – You conjure several icy boulders in a line 100 feet long, which crush anything beneath them. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage and 5d6 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th. You decide whether each extra die deals bludgeoning or cold damage.
  <em>Claws Of The Earth Dragon</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 170) – You summon the power of the earth dragon and shoot a ray at one target within 60 feet. The target falls prone and takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from being slammed to the ground. If the target was flying or levitating, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls. If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw, damage is halved, it doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by the attack increases by 1d8 and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Cloak Of Fiendish Menace</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 170) – You wrap yourself in an aura of fiendish power, intimidating those that face you. When a creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened. A frightened creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, the creature is no longer frightened and cannot again be affected by this particular casting of the spell. If you deal damage to a creature that is frightened by this spell, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its next turn, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature is unable to move toward you again while the spell is in effect, unless it makes a successful saving throw against the spell.
  <em>Sign Of Koth</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 249) – You invoke the twilight citadels of Koth to create a field of magical energy in the shape of a 60‐foot‐radius, 60‐foot‐tall cylinder centered on you. The only visible evidence of this field is a black rune that appears on every doorway, window, or other portal inside the area.  Choose one of the following creature types: aberration, beast, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead. The sign affects creatures of the chosen type (including you, if applicable) in the following ways:  • The creatures can’t willingly enter the cylinder’s area by nonmagical means; the cylinder acts as an invisible, impenetrable wall of force. If an affected creature tries to enter the cylinder’s area by using teleportation, a dimensional shortcut, or other magical means, it must make a successful Charisma saving throw or the attempt fails.  • They cannot hear any sounds that originate inside the cylinder.  • They have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets inside the cylinder.  • They can’t charm, frighten, or possess creatures inside the cylinder.  Creatures that aren’t affected by the field and that take a short rest inside it regain twice the usual number of hit points for each Hit Die spent at the end of the rest.
  <em>Sir Mittinz's Move Curse</em> (3rd-Level (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 249) – When you are within range of a cursed creature or object, you can transfer the curse to a different creature or object that’s also within range. The curse must be transferred from object to object or from creature to creature.
  <em>Sleep Of The Deep</em> (3rd-Level (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 249) – Your magic haunts the dreams of others. Choose a sleeping creature that you are aware of within range. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be targeted. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it garners no benefit from the rest, and when it awakens, it gains one level of exhaustion and is afflicted with short‐term madness.
  <em>Slippery Fingers</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 249) – You set a series of small events in motion that cause the targeted creature to drop one nonmagical item of your choice that it’s currently holding, unless it makes a successful Charisma saving throw.
  <em>Labyrinthine Howl</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 220) – You let loose the howl of a ravenous beast, causing each enemy within range that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature believes it has been transported into a labyrinth and is under attack by savage beasts. An affected creature must choose either to face the beasts or to curl into a ball for protection. A creature that faces the beasts takes 7d8 psychic damage, and then the spell ends on it. A creature that curls into a ball falls prone and is stunned until the end of your next turn.
  <em>Lacerate</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 220) – You make a swift cutting motion through the air to lacerate a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the wound erupts with a violent spray of blood, and the target gains one level of exhaustion.
  <em>Lair Sense</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 220) – You set up a magical boundary around your lair. The boundary can’t exceed the dimensions of a 100‐foot cube, but within that maximum, you can shape it as you like—to follow the walls of a building or cave, for example. While the spell lasts, you instantly become aware of any Tiny or larger creature that enters the enclosed area. You know the creature’s type but nothing else about it. You are also aware when creatures leave the area. This awareness is enough to wake you from sleep, and you receive the knowledge as long as you’re on the same plane of existence as your lair.
  <em>Nourishing Repast</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – You touch a supply of food and turn it into a magical substance that promotes healing and health. Enough food for up to six creatures can be transformed by the spell. The effects of the spell last for 24 hours or until the food is eaten. If the food is eaten during a short rest, it provides a +1 bonus to each Hit Die spent to regain hit points. If eaten as part of a long rest instead, then each creature partaking in the meal gains advantage on saving throws against disease or poison for the next 8 hours.
  <em>Obtuse O</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – You temporarily cloud the mind of a creature within range, inhibiting its decision-making skills. If the target succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Wisdom check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Opportunistic Foresight</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – You instill a creature you touch with the ability to predict and react to advantages in combat. For the duration of the spell, the target gains a bonus action each turn that it can use to make an opportunity attack against a provoking opponent. The target gains advantage on any opportunity attacks it takes while the spell is in effect.
  <em>Orb Of Light</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – An orb of light the size of your hand shoots from your fingertips toward a creature within range, which takes 3d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 round. A target that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage and is not blinded. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Outflanking Boon</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – This spell targets one enemy, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, an illusory ally of yours appears in a space from which it threatens to make a melee attack against the target. Your allies gain advantage on melee attacks against the target for the duration because of the distracting effect of the illusion. An affected target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell targets one additional enemy for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Overwhelming Greed</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 231) – You fill the target with a dragon's greed for wealth. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with greed, coveting any coins, jewelry, or art objects it can see that have a value of at least 1 gold piece, as well as jealously guarding any wealth it already owns. The target fixates on the most valuable-looking item or items, or the largest concentration of valuables in sight. It will not willingly let the wealth out of its sight. If the target sees an opportunity, it will take the valuables it has fixated on, gaining them by whatever means necessary. If doing so provokes a situation where it takes damage or is otherwise harmed, the affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. If the creature fails the save, it will continue to try to acquire the wealth, fighting back if necessary. Ending the Effect. If the affected creature ends its turn in an area where it cannot see any obviously valuable objects to covet, nor any creatures that might conceivably attempt to take its own property (a horse, for example, would not be considered such a creature), then it can make another Wisdom saving throw. A successful save ends the spell, and the creature recognizes its feelings of greed as magically induced. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Roaring Winds Of Limbo</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 241) – You tear open a breach to the planes of chaos, and the act of doing so fills an area with a dangerous windstorm. The area consists of twelve 10‐foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face in common with a face of another cube. Each creature in the area is deafened, and any sound it makes cannot be heard outside the area. The wind disperses all gases and vapors and extinguishes all unprotected flames in the area, and has a 75 percent chance of extinguishing protected flames, such as lanterns. All Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight made by a creature in the area have disadvantage due to the dust, grit, and debris being cast about. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet in a random direction. (Roll a d8, designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.) The wind also hampers movement; a creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can bombard up to twelve creatures in the area with flying debris, dealing 2d10 bludgeoning, 2d10 piercing, and 2d10 slashing damage. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage.
  <em>Rolling Thunder</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 241) – A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell. While a creature is deafened in this way, it is wreathed in thundering energy; it takes 2d8 thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Rotting Corpse</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 241) – Your familiarity with the foul effects of death allows you to prevent a dead body from being returned to life using anything but the most powerful forms of magic. You cast this spell by touching a creature that died within the last 24 hours. The body immediately decomposes to a state that prevents the body from being returned to life by the raise dead spell (though a resurrection spell still works). At the end of this spell’s duration, the body decomposes to a rancid slime, and it can’t be returned to life except through a true resurrection spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional corpse for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Rune Of Imprisonment</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 241) – You trace a glowing black rune in the air which streaks toward and envelops its target. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a successful hit, the rune absorbs the target creature, leaving only the glowing rune hanging in the space the target occupied. The subject can take no actions while imprisoned, nor can the subject be targeted or affected by any means. Any spell durations or conditions affecting the creature are postponed until the creature is freed. A dying creature does not lose hit points or stabilize until freed. A creature adjacent to the rune can use a move action to attempt to disrupt its energies; doing so allows the imprisoned creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this disruption negates the imprisonment and ends the effect. Disruption can be attempted only once per round.
  <em>Fire Darts</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 196) – When this spell is cast on any fire that’s at least as large as a small campfire or cooking fire, three darts of flame shoot out from the fire toward creatures within 30 feet of the fire. Darts can be directed against the same or separate targets as the caster chooses. Each dart deals 4d6 fire damage, or half as much damage if its target makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
  <em>Fire Dragon's Fury</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 196) – You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of the fire dragon, growing protective scales, wings, and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing. You can take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws, dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You are resistant to fire. Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of flames, dealing 6d8 fire damage to all creatures in the cone. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon. Finally, the wings grant you a flying speed of 40 feet.
  <em>Fire Under The Tongue</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 196) – You can ingest a nonmagical fire up to the size of a normal campfire that is within range. The fire is stored harmlessly in your mouth and dissipates without effect if it is not used before the spell ends. You can spit out the stored fire as an action. If you try to hit a particular target, then treat this as a ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. Campfire-sized flames deal 2d6 fire damage, while torch-sized flames deal 1d6 fire damage. Once you have spit it out, the fire goes out immediately unless it hits flammable material that can keep it fed.
  <em>Firewalk</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 196) – The creature you cast firewalk on becomes immune to fire damage. In addition, that creature can walk along any burning surface, such as a burning wall or burning oil spread on water, as if it were solid and horizontal. Even if there is no other surface to walk on, the creature can walk along the tops of the flames.
  <em>Tome Curse</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 265) – You protect a book by writing a curse in it with ink made from the material components of this spell. The writing is typically a couplet or a quatrain that warns of the consequences of disturbing your property. The curse is triggered by an action or actions that you specify (which typically involves someone reading the book without permission, trying to damage the book, or trying to steal it). When the curse is triggered, the creature that did so must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer its effect. You can choose one of the effects described in the bestow curse spell, or you can affect the target in one of the following ways:  • While the target is cursed, it is blinded.  • Beasts are unusually hostile to the target while it is cursed; they gain advantage on attack rolls against the target.  • While cursed, the target is an attractive mark to pickpockets and other thieves, and such individuals will try to steal the target’s valuables when the opportunity presents itself. (Even if in the target’s possession, the cursed book does not count as one of the target’s valuables.)  • A cursed target that either receives magical healing or rolls Hit Dice to recover hit points after a long rest must roll twice and use the lower result.  A remove curse spell ends this effect. You can also stipulate other actions taken by the target that would nullify the curse (returning the book after it is stolen, for example).
  <em>Tongue Of Sand</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 265) – Tongue of sand is similar in many ways to magic mouth. When you cast it, you implant a message in a quantity of sand. The sand must fill a space no smaller than 4 square feet and at least 2 inches deep. The message can be up to 25 words. You also decide the conditions that trigger the speaking of the message. When the message is triggered, a mouth forms in the sand and delivers the message in a raspy, whispered voice that can be heard by creatures within 10 feet of the sand.  Additionally, tongue of sand has the ability to interact in a simple, brief manner with creatures who hear its message. For up to 10 minutes after the message is triggered, questions addressed to the sand will be answered as you would answer them. Each answer can be no more than ten words long, and the spell ends after a second question is answered.
  <em>Tongue Tied</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 265) – You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally. The target’s speech becomes garbled, and it has disadvantage on Charisma checks that require speech. The creature can cast a spell that has a verbal component only by making a successful Constitution check against your spell save DC. On a failed check, the creature’s action is used but the spell slot isn’t expended.
  <em>Torrent Of Fire</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 265) – You harness the power of fire contained in ley lines with this spell. You create a 60‐foot cone of flame. Creatures in the cone take 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. You can then flow along the flames, reappearing anywhere inside the cone’s area. This repositioning doesn’t count as movement and doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks.
  <em>Touch Of The Unliving</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 265) – Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and, if it is not an undead creature, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Arcane Sight</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 147) – The recipient of this spell gains the benefits of both true seeing and detect magic until the spell ends, and they also know the name and effect of every spell they witness during the spell’s duration.
  <em>As You Were</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 147) – When cast on a dead or undead body, as you were returns that creature to the appearance it had in life while it was healthy and uninjured. The target must have a physical body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal. If as you were is cast on a corpse, its effect is identical to that of gentle repose, except that the corpse’s appearance is restored to that of a healthy, uninjured (albeit dead) person. If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life. Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious. (Knowing that the person should be dead is sufficient reason.) Spells and abilities that detect undead are also fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to Turn Undead as normal. This spell doesn’t confer the ability to speak on undead that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before. The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early. Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also ends the spell. If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.
  <em>Ashen Memories</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 147) – You touch the ashes, embers, or soot left behind by a fire and receive a vision of one significant event that occurred in the area while the fire was burning. For example, if you were to touch the cold embers of a campfire, you might witness a snippet of a conversation that occurred around the fire. Similarly, touching the ashes of a burned letter might grant you a vision of the person who destroyed the letter or the contents of the letter. You have no control over what information the spell reveals, but your vision usually is tied to the most meaningful event related to the fire. The GM determines the details of what is revealed.
  <em>Aspect Of The Ape</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 147) – You alter the appearance of a creature you touch, giving it a more simian form. While this spell is in effect, the subject gains a climbing speed equal to its normal walking speed, and gains advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made when jumping or climbing. When up in a tree’s branches (or in a similar area, at the GM’s discretion) the target can move up to its climbing speed as a bonus action, using brachiation to reach a nearby tree if the branches are close enough together. This bonus action can be taken only if the subject has at least two hands free, or one hand free if the subject is barefoot.
  <em>Blinding Pain</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 157) – You cause a creature within range to suffer severe pain in its head. At the start of its turn, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is blinded for 1 round. On a successful Wisdom saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded. A cure wounds or healing word spell cast on the target ends this spell, in addition to its regular effects.
  <em>Blizzard</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 157) – A howling storm of thick snow and ice crystals appears in a cylinder 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter within range. The area is heavily obscured by the swirling snow. When the storm appears, each creature in the area takes 8d8 cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature also makes this saving throw and takes damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from this spell has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration until the start of its next turn.
  <em>Blood And Steel</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 157) – When you cast this spell, you cut your hand and take 1d4 slashing damage that can’t be healed until you take a long rest. You then touch a construct; it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that are immune to charm effects can be affected by this spell. While the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack the ghouls,” “Block the bridge,” or, “Fetch that bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends itself. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also cause the construct to use a reaction, but doing this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the construct takes damage, it makes a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. If the construct is already under your control when the spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher score) for 4 hours. The construct is capable of acting independently, though it remains loyal to you for the spell’s duration. You can also grant the target a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier on one skill in which you have proficiency.
  <em>Curse Of Incompetence</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 180) – By making mocking gestures toward one creature within range that can see you, you leave the creature incapable of performing at its best. If the target fails on an Intelligence saving throw, roll a d4 and refer to the following table to determine what the target does on its turn.
  <em>Curse Of Yig</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 180) – This spell transforms a Small, Medium, or Large creature that you can see within range into a servant of Yig (see Creature Codex). An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom saving throw, negating the effect with a success. A willing creature is automatically affected and remains so for as long as you maintain concentration on the spell.
  <em>Curse Ring</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 180) – You lay a curse upon a ring you touch that isn’t being worn or carried. When you cast this spell, select one of the possible effects of bestow curse. The next creature that willingly wears the ring suffers the chosen effect with no saving throw.
  <em>Curse Of The Grave</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 180) – You tap your connection to death to curse a humanoid, making the grim pull of the grave stronger on that creature’s soul.
  <em>Conjure Mock Animals</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 175) – You summon fey spirits that take the outward appearance of animals, but merely to serve as a distraction and trap for the unwary. The spell functions as conjure animals, but each mock animal has only 1 hit point and deals only 1 damage on a hit regardless of its appearance. When a mock animal is dropped to 0 hit points, it explodes in a flash of light, dealing 2d4 radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Each creature that takes damage must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded for 1 round.
  <em>Conjure Nightmare</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 175) – You call forth a nightmare to serve you. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you choose within range. The nightmare will serve you as a mount, in combat and out. The nightmare is friendly to you and your companions for the duration and follows any commands you issue to it. If your concentration is broken, the nightmare is no longer bound by the spell. It might leave immediately, especially if it has been wounded or threatened, but it is just as likely to attack you or an ally, or otherwise gain retribution for being summoned and bound to your service. If you provide the nightmare with a sacrifice it can devour when it is first summoned, it will be appeased enough to simply return home once the spell ends, without causing harm to you or your companions.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Conjure Scarab Swarm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 175) – You summon swarms of scarab beetles to attack your foes. Two swarms of insects (beetles) appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Each swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The swarms are friendly to you and your allies. Make one initiative roll for both swarms, which have their own turns. They obey verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.
  <em>Conjure Spectral Dead</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 175) – You summon a shroud (see Tome of Beasts) to do your bidding. The creature appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature is friendly to you and your allies for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 3rd‐level spell slot, you can choose to summon two shrouds or one specter. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can choose to summon four shrouds or one will‐o’‐wisp.
  <em>Fortitude</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – Transmutation Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Constitution check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.
  <em>Frailty</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – Necromancy Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: 1 minute You temporarily inhibit the vital force of a creature within range. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Constitution check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Freeze Blood</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – 3rd-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You freeze a creature’s blood with a successful melee spell attack. The target must be a living creature with a circulatory system. For the duration, the target’s speed is halved, and it takes 2d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. In addition, if it takes bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, the attack’s damage dice are rolled three times instead of twice. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
  <em>Freeze Potion</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – 1st-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within range about to consume a liquid Range: 25 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous A blue spark flies from your hand and strikes a potion vial, drinking horn, waterskin, or similar container, instantly freezing the contents. The substance melts normally thereafter and is not otherwise harmed, but it can’t be consumed while it’s frozen. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Freezing Fog</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – 3rd-Level Conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: 100 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes The spell creates a 20‐foot‐radius sphere of mist similar to a fog cloud spell centered on a point you can see within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and the area it occupies is heavily obscured. A wind of moderate or greater velocity (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. The fog is freezing cold; any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d6 cold damage and gains one level of exhaustion on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and no exhaustion on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Frenzied Bolt</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 200) – 2nd-Level Evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous You direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature of your choice within range. If the bolt hits, the target takes 3d8 damage, of a type determined by rolling on the Random Damage Type table. If your attack roll (not the adjusted result) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of your choice within range that has not already been targeted by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even number on your spell attack roll, miss  a target, or run out of potential targets. You and your allies are legal targets for this spell, if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky. and 3d6 cold damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature that takes cold damage from frozen razors is reduced to half speed until the start of its next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Illusory Trap</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 215) – You create the illusion of a trap upon an object you touch, such as a door, a chest, or a 5‐foot‐square area of floor. A creature specifically looking for traps that examines the object must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage, the spell ends, and the creature realizes that the trap was not real.  On a failed save, the creature believes the object contains a trap. If the creature then tries to disarm or otherwise interact with the trap in order to set it off, it must make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage and realizes the trap is not real. On a failed check, the creature takes 5d10 psychic damage and is stunned for 1 round, believing that it accidentally set off the trap and was injured by it.
  <em>Impending Ally</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 215) – You summon a duplicate of yourself as an ally who appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. You control this ally, whose turn comes immediately after yours. When you or the ally uses a class feature, spell slot, or other expendable resource, it’s considered expended for both of you. When the spell ends, or if you are killed, the ally disappears immediately.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Impotence</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 215) – You temporarily weaken a creature within range. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the target makes a Strength check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.
  <em>Indecision</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 215) – Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be overcome with indecision. On a failed save, the target takes its entire turn to perform its next action due to the creature’s hesitation. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it takes no action that round. If the creature has moved before taking an action, its action does not occur until the start of its next turn. Each round, the creature can attempt another saving throw at the start of its turn. On a successful save, the spell ends.  This spell has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or lower.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Innocuous Aspect</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 215) – An area of false vision encompasses all creatures within 20 feet of you. You and each creature in the area that you choose to affect take on the appearance of a harmless creature or object, chosen by you. Each image is identical, and only appearance is affected. Sound, movement, or physical inspection can reveal the ruse.  A creature that uses its action to study the image visually can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, that creature sees through the image.
  <em>Protective Ice</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 235) – When you cast protective ice, you encase a willing target in icy, medium armor equivalent to a breastplate (AC 14). A creature without the appropriate armor proficiency has the usual penalties. If the target is already wearing armor, it only uses the better of the two armor classes. A creature striking a target encased in protective ice with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d6 cold damage. If the armor’s wearer takes fire damage, an equal amount of damage is done to the armor, which has 30 hit points and is damaged only when its wearer takes fire damage. Damaged ice can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point‐for‐point basis, but the armor can’t have more than 30 points repaired. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th‐level spell slot, it creates splint armor (AC 17, 40 hit points). If you cast this spell using a 5th‐level spell slot, it creates plate armor (AC 18, 50 hit points). The armor’s hit points increase by 10 for each spell slot above 5th, but the AC remains 18. Additionally, if you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the armor deals an extra +2 cold damage for each spell slot above 3rd.
  <em>Protective Nimbus</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 235) – You wrap yourself in a corona that sheds bright light in a 20‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
  <em>Puff Of Smoke</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 235) – By harnessing the elemental power of fire, you warp nearby air into obscuring smoke. One creature you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the creature is blinded until the start of your next turn. Puff of smoke has no effect on creatures that have tremorsense or blindsight.
  <em>Pummelstone</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 235) – You cause a fist‐sized chunk of stone to appear and hurl itself against the spell’s target. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must roll a d4 when it makes an attack roll or ability check during its next turn, subtracting the result of the d4 from the attack or check roll. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Pyroclasm</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 235) – You point toward an area of ground or a similar surface within range. A geyser of lava erupts from the chosen spot. The geyser is 5 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. Each creature in the cylinder when it erupts or at the start of your turn takes 10d8 fire damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. The geyser also forms a pool of lava at its base. Initially, the pool is the same size as the geyser, but at the start of each of your turns for the duration, the pool’s radius increases by 5 feet. A creature in the pool of lava (but not in the geyser) at the start of your turn takes 5d8 fire damage. When a creature leaves the pool of lava, its speed is reduced by half and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, caused by a hardening layer of lava. These penalties last until the creature uses an action to break the hardened stone away from itself.  If you maintain concentration on pyroclasm for a full minute, the lava geyser and pool harden into permanent, nonmagical stone. A creature in either area when the stone hardens is restrained until the stone is broken away.
  <em>Bolster Undead</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 161) – You suffuse an area with negative energy to increase the difficulty of harming or affecting undead creatures. Choose up to three undead creatures within range. When a targeted creature makes a saving throw against being turned or against spells or effects that deal radiant damage, the target has advantage on the saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional undead creature for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Bolstering Brew</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 161) – Calling upon the patron deity of brewers, you bring forth a vibrant brew of beer or ale. Up to six other creatures within range can partake of this drink with you and share in its magical benefits, each drawing a mug from the small keg of magical brew that appears. A creature that downs a mug of magical beer gains advantage on either all Strength checks or all Charisma checks (chosen when it drinks), is immune to being frightened, and makes all Constitution saving throws with advantage. These benefits last for 8 hours.
  <em>Bones Of Stone</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 161) – The bones of a creature you touch gain the strength and density of stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to slashing damage and bludgeoning damage, and it gains advantage on Strength checks against effects that would move the target against its will.
  <em>Booster Shot</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 161) – You imbue a two‐handed ranged weapon (typically a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or heavy crossbow) that you touch with a random magical benefit. While the spell lasts, a projectile fired from the weapon has an effect that occurs on a hit in addition to its normal damage. Roll a d6 to determine the additional effect for each casting of this spell. 1 2d10 acid damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target 3 2d10 necrotic damage to the target, and the target has disadvantage on its first attack roll before the start of the weapon user’s next turn 5 2d10 force damage to the target, and the target is pushed 20 feet At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, all damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Boreas's Embrace</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 161) – You cause a downburst of freezing cold wind and rain with a 15‐foot radius, which freezes in moments into a sheet of slick, encasing ice. All fires in the area are extinguished. Creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 6d6 cold damage and being restrained on a failed save or half as much damage and no additional effects on a successful one. Anyone entering or moving through the affected area for 1 minute afterward must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. d6 Effect 2 2d10 lightning damage to the target and 1d10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 5‐foot‐wide line between the weapon and the target 4 2d10 cold damage to the target and 1d10 cold damage to all other creatures in a 60‐foot cone in front of the weapon 6 2d10 psychic damage to the target, and the target is stunned until the start of the weapon user’s next turn At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may either inflict an additional 1d6 cold damage or increase the duration of the ice slick by 1 minute for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Searing Sun</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – This spell intensifies the light and heat of the sun, so that it burns exposed flesh. You must be able to see the sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high, centered on the a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes 5d8 fire damage, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that’s shaded by a solid object —such as an awning, a building, or an overhanging boulder— has advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet along the ground in any direction.
  <em>Thunder Bolt</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 261) – You cast a knot of thunder at one enemy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage and can’t use reactions until the start of your next turn. The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
  <em>Thunderclap</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 261) – You clap your hands, emitting a peal of thunder. Each creature within 20 feet of you takes 8d4 thunder damage and is deafened for 1d8 rounds, or it takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. On a saving throw that fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned for 1 round. This spell doesn’t function in an area affected by a silence spell. Very brittle material such as crystal might be shattered if it’s within range, at the GM’s discretion; a character holding such an object can protect it from harm by making a successful Dexterity saving throw.
  <em>Thunderous Charge</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 261) – With a thunderous battle cry, you move up to 10 feet in a straight line and make a melee weapon attack. If it hits, you can choose to either gain a +5 bonus on the attack’s damage or shove the target 10 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the distance you can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional 1d6 thunder damage, for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Thunderous Stampede</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 261) – This spell acts as thunderous charge, but affecting up to three targets within range, including yourself. A target other than you must use its reaction to move and attack under the effect of thunderous stampede. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the distance your targets can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional 1d6 thunder damage, for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Thunderous Wave</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 261) – You initiate a shock wave centered at a point you designate within range. The wave explodes outward into a 30‐foot‐radius sphere. This force deals no damage directly, but every creature the wave passes through must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet and knocked prone; if it strikes a solid obstruction, it also takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, a creature is pushed 15 feet and not knocked prone, and it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage if it strikes an obstruction. The spell also emits a thunderous boom that can be heard within 400 feet.
  <em>Twist The Skein</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 269) – You tweak a strand of a creature’s fate as it attempts an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll a d20 and subtract 10 to produce a number from 10 to –9. Add that number to the creature’s roll. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it might not change the outcome at all.
  <em>Uncanny Avoidance</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 269) – You extend a hand and point a finger at a creature within range. Your magic grants the target enhanced awareness of attacks directed at it. The next attack roll against the creature before the spell ends is made with disadvantage.
  <em>Uncontrollable Transformation</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 269) – You infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a d10 and consult the Uncontrollable Transformation table below to determine what mutation occurs. You can try to control the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer, but doing so is taxing; you can roll a d10 twice and choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of exhaustion. At the end of the spell, your body returns to its normal form.  Mutation 1 A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools. 3 A puckered orifice grows on your back. You can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. You must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier. 5 You grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. You gain immunity to inhaled poisons. 7 You become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can’t pick up or interact with physical objects that you weren’t carrying when you became incorporeal. 9 Your head fills with a light gas and swells to four times its normal size, causing your hair to fall out. You have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and can levitate up to 5 feet above the ground. 2 Your skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll on the Damage Type table in the frenzied bolt spell description). 4 A face appears on the back of your head. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on sight‐based and scent‐based Wisdom (Perception) checks. You become adept at carrying on conversations with yourself. 6 Your hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20. 8 Your limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. You gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. 10 You grow feathered wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover.
  <em>Undermine Armor</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 270) – You unravel the bonds of reality that hold a suit of armor together. A target wearing armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its armor softens to the consistency of candle wax, decreasing the target’s AC by 2. Undermine armor has no effect on creatures that aren’t wearing armor.
  <em>Unholy Defiance</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 270) – Until the spell ends, undead creatures within range have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead. If an undead creature within this area has the Turning Defiance trait, that creature can roll a d4 when it makes a saving throw against an effect that turns undead and add the number rolled to the saving throw.
  <em>Unleash Effigy</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 270) – You cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of a stone golem. It takes a turn immediately after your turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem to move and attack, provided you’re within 60 feet of it. Without orders from you, the statue does nothing. Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it’s destroyed. When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a normal, mundane statue.
  <em>Unluck On That</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 270) – By uttering a swift curse (“Unluck on that!”), you bring misfortune to the target’s attempt; the affected creature has disadvantage on the roll.
  <em>Thunderstorm</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 262) – You touch a willing creature, and it becomes surrounded by a roiling storm cloud 30 feet in diameter, erupting with (harmless) thunder and lightning. The creature gains a flying speed of 60 feet. The cloud heavily obscures the creature inside it from view, though it is transparent to the creature itself.
  <em>Tidal Barrier</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 262) – A swirling wave of seawater surrounds you, crashing and rolling in a 10-foot radius around your space. The area is difficult terrain, and a creature that starts its turn there or that enters it for the first time on a turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
  <em>Time In A Bottle</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 262) – You designate a spot within your sight. Time comes under your control in a 20-foot radius centered on that spot. You can freeze it, reverse it, or move it forward by as much as 1 minute as long as you maintain concentration. Nothing and no one, yourself included, can enter the field or affect what happens inside it. You can choose to end the effect at any moment as an action on your turn.
  <em>Time Jaunt</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 262) – When you cast this spell, you step outside the normal time stream, seeming to vanish as 1 round of time passes. You can make minor alterations to the scene being played out, becoming visible for an instant each time you make an adjustment that aids an ally or hinders foes. To everyone else, you disappear when the spell is cast, then flicker into and out of view during the next round, before reappearing for good in the space you vanished from 1 round later, whereupon the spell ends. You cannot be attacked by any means while under the effect of this spell. As the round progresses, you can choose to bestow a single effect on each creature involved in the combat, choosing from the list below. You cannot take any other actions during the round: • Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw it is about to make. • Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on an attack roll it is about to make. • Alter the location of a mobile object to provide or remove cover for a creature. • Shift objects into the path of a creature; the first 10 feet of terrain it must travel becomes difficult terrain. • After an attack roll is determined to be successful, adjust the angle of the strike or the positioning of the target, either causing the strike to deal half as much damage or providing a bonus to damage equal to half your level. Example of Combat. An adventuring party encounters four trolls in their lair. Initiative is rolled, and the order is fighter 20, cleric 15, rogue 14, trolls 12, wizard 10. Events unfold in this way: Fighter draws sword and attacks troll #1. Cleric casts time jaunt and disappears. Rogue fires an arrow at troll #2. Cleric yanks the troll’s arm, turning it broadside for a better target and giving the rogue advantage on the attack roll. The attack hits. Troll #1 swings at the fighter. Cleric gives the fighter’s shield a nudge to raise it just a little faster. Troll has disadvantage on the attack roll and misses. Troll #2 throws a spear at the rogue. Cleric flips a table over between the rogue and the troll, giving the rogue cover against the attack. Attack roll is still high enough to hit. Troll #3 charges the fighter. Cleric tips over an open barrel of pickled herring, strewing the contents across the floor and making the first 10 feet in the troll’s path difficult terrain. As a result, troll #3 does not have enough movement to reach the fighter on its turn. Troll #4 moves and attacks the fighter, scoring a hit. Cleric pulls on the troll’s weapon arm so the strike is a glancing one rather than a direct hit, and the attack deals half as much damage. Wizard casts grease on the area where trolls #1 and #4 are standing. Cleric gives each a swift kick to the back of the knee. Trolls have disadvantage on their Dexterity saving throws, fail their saves, and fall prone. Fighter stabs at troll #1, scoring a hit. Cleric gives the troll’s arm a yank, moving it just enough that the fighter hits the monster’s chest rather than its shoulder, providing the fighter a bonus of +7 (half the cleric’s level) on the attack’s damage. Cleric pops back into view, occupying the space where time jaunt was cast, then takes the next turn in round 2 as normal.
  <em>See Beyond</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 245) – This spell enables a willing creature you touch to see through any obstructions as if they were transparent. For the duration, the target can see into and through opaque objects, creatures, spells, and effects that obstruct line of sight to a range of 30 feet. Inside that distance, the creature can choose what it perceives as opaque and what it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects. Although the creature can see any target within 30 feet of itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before casting a spell or making an attack against that target. For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total cover but can’t shoot that enemy with an arrow because the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be targeted by a geas spell, however, because geas needs only a visible target.
  <em>Seed Of Destruction</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 245) – This spell impregnates a living creature with a rapidly gestating hydra that consumes the target from within before emerging to wreak havoc on the world. Make a ranged spell attack against a living creature within range that you can see. On a hit, you implant a five‐headed embryonic growth into the creature. Roll 1d3 + 1 to determine how many rounds it takes the embryo to mature. During the rounds when the embryo is gestating, the affected creature takes 5d4 slashing damage at the start of its turn, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. When the gestation period has elapsed, a tiny hydra erupts from the target’s abdomen at the start of your turn. The hydra appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and immediately grows into a full‐size Huge aberration. Nearby creatures are pushed away to clear a sufficient space as the hydra grows. This creature is a standard hydra, but with the ability to cast bane as an action (spell save DC 11) requiring no spell components. Roll initiative for the hydra, which takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t give it a command or it can’t follow your command, the hydra attacks the nearest living creature. At the end of each of the hydra’s turns, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the hydra remains under your control and friendly to you and your companions. On a failed save, your control ends, the hydra becomes hostile to all creatures, and it attacks the nearest creature to the best of its ability. The hydra disappears at the end of the spell’s duration, or its existence can be cut short with a wish spell or comparable magic, but nothing less. The embryo can be destroyed before it reaches maturity by using a dispel magic spell under the normal rules for dispelling high‐level magic.
  <em>Seer's Reaction</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 245) – Your foreknowledge allows you to act before others, because you knew what was going to happen. When you cast this spell, make a new initiative roll with a +5 bonus. If the result is higher than your current initiative, your place in the initiative order changes accordingly. If the result is also higher than the current place in the initiative order, you take your next turn immediately and then use the higher number starting in the next round.
  <em>Semblance Of Dread</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 245) – You adopt the visage of the faceless god Nyarlathotep. For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you and able to see you can’t willingly move closer to you unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. For the duration of the spell, you also gain vulnerability to radiant damage and have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition.
  <em>Boreas's Kiss</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 162) – You encapsulate a creature within range in a pocket of fiercely cold air. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop any object in hand. They also have disadvantage on any cold‐based saving throws until they make a successful Constitution saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may extend the duration by 1 minute. Alternatively, for every two levels above 1st level, you may instead choose to have the target suffer a level of exhaustion on the first failed saving throw, up to a maximum of three levels of exhaustion.
  <em>Bottled Arcana</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 162) – By touching an empty, stoppered glass container such as a vial or flask, you magically enable it to hold a single spell. To be captured, the spell must be cast within 1 round of casting bottled arcana and it must be intentionally cast into the container. The container can hold one spell of 3rd level or lower. The spell can be held in the container for as much as 24 hours, after which the container reverts to a mundane vessel and any magic inside it dissipates harmlessly. As an action, any creature can unstop the container, thereby releasing the spell. If the spell has a range of self, the creature opening the container is affected; otherwise, the creature opening the container designates the target according to the captured spell’s description. If a creature opens the container unwittingly (not knowing that the container holds a spell), the spell targets the creature opening the container or is centered on its space instead (whichever is more appropriate). Dispel magic cast on the container targets bottled arcana, not the spell inside. If bottled arcana is dispelled, the container becomes mundane and the spell inside dissipates harmlessly. Until the spell in the container is released, its caster can’t regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. Once the spell is released, its caster regains the use of that slot normally. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of the spell the container can hold increases by one for every slot level above 5th.
  <em>Bottomless Stomach</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 162) – When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to consume dangerous substances and contain them in an extradimensional reservoir in your stomach. The spell allows you to swallow most liquids, such as acids, alcohol, poison, and even quicksilver, and hold them safely in your stomach. You are unaffected by swallowing the substance, but the spell doesn’t give you resistance or immunity to the substance in general; for example, you could safely drink a bucket of a black dragon’s acidic spittle, but you’d still be burned if you were caught in the dragon’s breath attack or if that bucket of acid were dumped over your head. The spell allows you to store up to 10 gallons of liquid at one time. The liquid doesn’t need to all be of the same type, and different types don’t mix while in your stomach. Any liquid in excess of 10 gallons has its normal effect when you try to swallow it. At any time before you stop concentrating on the spell, you can regurgitate up to 1 gallon of liquid stored in your stomach as a bonus action. The liquid is vomited into an adjacent 5‐foot square. A target in that square must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the liquid. The GM determines the exact effect based on the type of liquid regurgitated, using 1d6 damage of the appropriate type as the baseline. When you stop concentrating on the spell, its duration expires, or it’s dispelled, the extradimensional reservoir and the liquid it contains cease to exist.
  <em>Boulder Toss</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 162) – You draw the power of the mountains into you, gaining a surge of strength that allows you to take an action to hurl a rock (or similar object) as a giant does. Your Strength is considered to be 19 for the purpose of determining damage from objects that you hurl.  Your hurled rock has a range of 60/240 feet and deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC or be knocked prone. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, your Strength is considered to be 21, and the bludgeoning damage increases to 3d10. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, your Strength is considered to be 23, and the bludgeoning damage increases to 4d10.
  <em>Icy Manipulation</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 214) – One creature you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified (frozen solid). A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permanent. The petrification also becomes permanent if you maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to normal with greater restoration or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute. If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it recovers from being petrified, the injury carries over to its normal state.
  <em>Ill-Fated Word</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 214) – You call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening its chance to succeed at whatever it’s doing. Roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome of its roll.
  <em>Illuminate Spoor</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 214) – You touch a set of tracks created by a single creature. That set of tracks and all other tracks made by the same creature give off a faint glow. You and up to three creatures that can see the glow automatically succeed on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track that creature. If the tracks are covered by obscuring objects such as leaves or mud, you and the creatures you designate have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow the tracks. If the creature leaving the tracks changes its tracks, such as by adding or removing footwear, the glow stops where the tracks change. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to touch and illuminate a new set of tracks.
  <em>Icicle Daggers</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 214) – When you cast this spell, three icicles appear in your hand. Each icicle has the same properties as a dagger but deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a hit. The icicle daggers melt a few seconds after leaving your hand, making it impossible for other creatures to wield them. If the surrounding temperature is at or below freezing, the daggers last for 1 hour. They melt instantly if you take 10 or more fire damage.
  <em>Quench</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 236) – You extinguish all nonmagical fires in a 30‐foot‐radius area centered on the point at which you cast the spell. You can extinguish fire spells in the area as well. For each fire spell in the area, make a Wisdom check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.  Fire elementals in the area take 8d6 cold damage. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage by half.
  <em>Quick Time</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 236) – You make one living creature or plant within range move rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil, or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling, causing it to become a full‐grown duck. If the target is a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging. It can choose to fail the saving throw.
  <em>Quicken</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 236) – You touch one willing creature. Once before the duration of the spell expires, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an initiative roll or Dexterity saving throw it has just made. The spell then ends.
  <em>Quicksilver Mantle</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 236) – You transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective, silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a ray of enfeeblement, scorching ray, or even disintegrate, roll 1d4. On a result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays after the first affect you as normal.
  <em>Quintessence</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 236) – By calling upon an archangel, you become infused with celestial essence and take on angelic features such as golden skin, glowing eyes, and ethereal wings. For the duration of the spell, your Armor Class can’t be lower than 20, you can’t be frightened, and you are immune to necrotic damage.  In addition, each hostile creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of you or enters that area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way is restrained. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the frightening effect of the spell until you cast quintessence again.
  <em>Forest Sanctuary</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 199) – While in a forest, you create a protective, 200‐foot cube centered on a point you can see within range. The atmosphere inside the cube has the lighting, temperature, and moisture that is most ideal for the forest, regardless of the lighting or weather outside the area. The cube is transparent, and creatures and objects can move freely through it. The cube protects the area inside it from storms, strong winds, and floods, including those created by magic such as control weather, control water, or meteor swarm. Such spells can’t be cast while the spellcaster is in the cube. You can create a permanently protected area by casting this spell at the same location every day for one year.
  <em>Form Of The Gods</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 199) – By drawing on the energy of the gods, you can temporarily assume the form of your patron’s avatar. Form of the gods transforms you into an entirely new shape and brings about the following changes (summarized below and in the avatar form stat block): • Your size becomes Large, unless you were already at least that big. • You gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and to one other damage type of your choice. • You gain a Multiattack action option, allowing you to make two slam attacks and a bite. • Your ability scores change to reflect your new form, as shown in the stat block. You remain in this form until you stop concentrating on the spell or until you drop to 0 hit points, at which time you revert to your natural form.
  <em>Foretell Distraction</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 199) – Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn’t count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you’re not hidden.
  <em>Avatar Form</em> ( <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 199) – Large  ARMOR CLASS 17  HIT POINTS 189 (18d10 + 90) SPEED 30 ft.  STR DEX  20 (+5) 18 (+4)  CON  20 (+5)  INT  18 (+4)  WIS  16 (+3)  CHA  20 (+5)  DAMAGE RESISTANCES bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, plus one additional type  SENSES darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13 LANGUAGES speaks all languages known in previous form CHALLENGE 18 (20,000 XP) PROFICIENCY BONUS +6  Awesome Presence. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw, that creature is immune to your Awesome Presence for 24 hours.
  <em>Conjure Undead</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 176) – You summon a shadow to do your bidding. The creature appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature is friendly to you and your allies for the duration. Roll initiative for the shadow, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The shadow disappears when the spell ends.
  <em>Consult The Storm</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 176) – You ask a question of an entity connected to storms, such as an elemental, a deity, or a primal spirit, and the entity replies with destructive fury. As part of the casting of the spell, you must speak a question consisting of fifteen words or fewer. Choose a point within range. A short, truthful answer to your question booms from that point. It can be heard clearly by any creature within 600 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the point takes 7d6 thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
  <em>Control Ice</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 176) – Until the spell ends, you control any ice inside an area you choose within range that can be as large as a cube 100 feet on a side. You choose one of the following three effects when you cast this spell. As an action on each of your turns thereafter, you can use the same effect or choose a different one. Any alterations made to the ice remain after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects (temperature, seismic action, or another application of this spell, for example).  Crack. You cause ice in the area to crack and splinter. On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain.  Reshape. You cause ice in a portion of the area to rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape you command. You can block holes, open tunnels, form bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the form of the ice in the area. You can cause ice to become slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove difficult terrain. You can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a chasm or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet square). You can continue this action on consecutive rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you maintain concentration on the spell.  Thicken/Thin. You cause existing ice to increase or decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on.
  <em>Converse With Dragon</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 176) – You gain limited telepathy, allowing you to communicate with any creature within 120 feet of you that has the dragon type, regardless of the creature’s languages. A dragon can choose to make a Charisma saving throw to prevent telepathic contact with itself. This spell doesn’t change a dragon’s disposition toward you or your allies, it only opens a channel of communication. In some cases, unwanted telepathic contact can worsen the dragon’s attitude toward you.
  <em>Cure Beast</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 179) – A beast of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting modifier.
  <em>Curse Of Boreas</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 179) – A whisper of freezing wind wafts from your lips in a 60‐foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 4d8 cold damage and being restrained on a failed save or half as much damage with no additional effect on a successful one.  A creature restrained by this spell takes 2d8 cold damage at the end of each of its turns and then must make another Charisma saving throw. It has advantage on this saving throw if it has taken any fire damage since the end of its last turn. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends for it. If it fails its save three times, it is shrouded in ice and restrained for 10 minutes.  The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  Another creature can free a restrained creature in 1 minute using fire or weapons to chip away the ice.
  <em>Curse Of Dust</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 179) – You cast a curse on a creature within range that you’re familiar with, causing it to be unsatiated by food no matter how much it eats. This effect isn’t merely an issue of perception; the target physically can’t draw sustenance from food. Within minutes after the spell is cast, the target feels constant hunger no matter how much food it consumes. The target must make a Constitution saving throw 24 hours after the spell is cast and every 24 hours thereafter. On a failed save, the target gains one level of exhaustion. The effect ends when the duration expires or when the target makes two consecutive successful saves.
  <em>Curse Of Hostility</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 179) – You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed with the antipathy of a certain type of creature, chosen you when you cast the spell. Choose one of the following: aberrations, beasts, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, plants, or undead. In situations involving creatures of the selected type, the following effects apply:  • In encounters with creatures of the selected type when the creatures are already hostile, they will attack the target of this spell in preference to other targets.  • A creature of the selected type gains advantage on any attack rolls made against the target if the target has attacked and hit that creature at least once during the encounter.  • The target has disadvantage on any Charisma‐based checks made against creatures of the chosen type.  A remove curse spell ends this effect.
  <em>Blood Armor</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 158) – When you strike a foe with a melee weapon attack, you can immediately cast blood armor as a bonus action. The foe you struck must contain blood; if the target doesn’t bleed, the spell ends without effect. The blood flowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of armor around you, granting you an Armor Class of 18 + your Dexterity modifier for the spell’s duration. This armor has no Strength requirement, doesn’t hinder spellcasting, and doesn’t incur disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the creature you struck was a celestial, blood armor also grants you advantage on Charisma saving throws for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Blood Lure</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 158) – You point at any location (a jar, a bowl, even a puddle) within range that contains at least a pint of blood. Each creature that feeds on blood and is within 60 feet of that location must make a Charisma saving throw. (This includes undead, such as vampires.) A creature that has Keen Smell or any similar scent‐boosting ability has disadvantage on the saving throw, while undead have advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is attracted to the blood and must move toward it unless impeded. Once an affected creature reaches the blood, it tries to consume it, foregoing all other actions while the blood is present. A successful attack against an affected creature ends the effect, as does the consumption of the blood, which requires an action by an affected creature.
  <em>Blood Offering</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 158) – You touch the corpse of a creature that isn’t undead or a construct and consume its life force. You must have dealt damage to the creature before it died, and it must have been dead for no more than 1 hour. You regain a number of hit points equal to 1d4 × the creature’s challenge rating (minimum of 1d4). The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
  <em>Blood Puppet</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 158) – With a sample of its blood, you are able to magically control a creature’s actions, like a marionette on magical strings. Choose a creature you can see within range whose blood you hold. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or you gain control over its physical activity (as long as you interact with the blood material component each round). As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the creature to perform various  activities. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or, “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. The target is aware of being controlled. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
  <em>Tracer</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can imbue a piece of ammunition you fire from a ranged weapon with a tiny, invisible beacon. If a ranged attack roll with an imbued piece of ammunition hits a target, the beacon is transferred to the target. The weapon that fired the ammunition is attuned to the beacon and becomes warm to the touch when it points in the direction of the target as long as the target is on the same plane of existence as you. You can have only one tracer target at a time. If you put a tracer on a different target, the effect on the previous target ends. A creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC to notice the magical beacon.
  <em>Tracking Beacon</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – You choose a creature within range to mark with a glowing orb of light, which floats 120 feet above the creature’s head. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the light hovers above the target’s location, moving as the target moves, which enables you to track the creature’s direction and distance by staying within sight of the beacon. The beacon continues to function even when you cannot see it, as long as the target remains on the same plane as you. If either you or the target travels to another plane, the spell ends. You can use a bonus action on your turn to adjust the height of the beacon, ranging from its starting point of 120 feet to as low as 5 feet above the head of the target.
  <em>Treasure Chasm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – You cause the glint of a golden coin to haze over the vision of one creature in range. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it sees a gorge, trench, or other hole in the ground, at a spot within range chosen by you, which is filled with gold and treasure. On its next turn, the creature must move toward that spot. When it reaches the spot, it becomes incapacitated, as it devotes all its attention to scooping imaginary treasure into its pockets or a pouch. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature takes damage from you or one of your allies. Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on the initial saving throw but have advantage on saving throws against this spell made after reaching the designated spot.
  <em>Tree Heal</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – You touch a plant, and it regains 1d4 hit points. Alternatively, you can cure it of one disease or remove pests from it. Once you cast this spell on a plant or plant creature, you can’t cast it on that target again for 24 hours. This spell can be used only on plants and plant creatures.
  <em>Tree Running</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – One willing creature you touch gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. This climbing speed functions only while the creature is in contact with a living plant or fungus that’s growing from the ground. The creature can cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast spells. The plant doesn’t give under the creature’s weight, so the creature can walk on the tiniest of tree branches, stand on a leaf, or run across the waving top of a field of wheat without bending a stalk or touching the ground.
  <em>Tree Speak</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 266) – You touch a tree and ask one question about anything that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such as “Who passed by here?”). You get a mental sensation of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell. Trees do not have a humanoid’s sense of time, so the tree might speak about something that happened last night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from the tree’s perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to anything that might harm the forest and always report such activities when questioned. If you cast this spell on a tree that contains a creature that can merge with trees, such as a dryad, you can freely communicate with the merged creature for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Animated Object Swarm</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – Myriad Tiny objects animate at your command, forming a swarm. The objects’ abilities conform to the rules stated in the animate objects spell, except that you animate only Tiny objects, which gather together into a Medium swarm. The area of the swarm is considered difficult terrain, and creatures in it are lightly obscured. The swarm has the following statistics: Armor Class: 18 Hit Points: 20  STR 4; DEX 18  Damage Resistances: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing Condition Immunities: charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) damage.
  <em>Animated Scroll</em> (Transmutation Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any beast that has a challenge rating of 0. It is made of paper, not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature can do: a paper owl can fly and attack with its talons, a paper frog can swim without disintegrating in water, and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose location you know. You can’t have more than one animated paper animal at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have an animated paper animal, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose any beast that has a challenge rating of 0. Your animated paper animal transforms into the chosen creature. The duration increases by 24 hours at 5th level (48 hours), 11th level (72 hours), and 17th level (96 hours).
  <em>Anticipate Arcana</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – Your foresight gives you an instant to ready your defenses against a magical attack. When you cast anticipate arcana, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Anticipate Attack</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – In a flash of foreknowledge, you spot an oncoming attack with enough time to avoid it. Upon casting this spell, you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The oncoming attack still occurs but misses automatically if you are no longer within the attack’s range, are in a space that’s impossible for the attack to hit, or can’t be targeted by that attack in your new position. If none of those circumstances apply but the situation has changed—you have moved into a position where you have cover, for example—then the attack is made after taking the new situation into account.
  <em>Anticipate Weakness</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – With a quick glance into the future, you pinpoint where a gap is about to open in your foe’s defense, and then you strike. After casting anticipate weakness, you have advantage on attack rolls until the end of your turn.
  <em>Arcane Parasite</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 146) – This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the energy instead comes from the external power. The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the duration of the arcane parasite spell by 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast using the link. For example, if you cast a fireball spell using the link, you would not expend a spell slot in the casting, but the duration of this spell would decrease by 30 minutes. If you cast a spell using the link and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as that spell is cast.
  <em>Feather Travel</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 195) – The target of feather travel (along with its clothing and other gear) transforms into a feather and drifts on the wind. The drifting creature has a limited ability to control its travel. It can move only in the direction the wind is blowing and at the speed of the wind. It can, however, shift up, down, or sideways 5 feet per round as if caught by a gust, allowing the creature to aim for an open window or doorway, to avoid a flame, or to steer around an animal or another creature. When the spell ends, the feather settles gently to the ground and transforms back into the original creature.
  <em>Fey Crown</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 195) – By channeling the ancient wards of the Seelie Court, you create a crown of five flowers on your head. While wearing this crown, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects and are immune to being charmed. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself). Until the end of its next turn, the chosen creature is invisible and has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Each time a chosen creature becomes invisible, one of the blossoms in the crown closes. After the last of the blossoms closes, the spell ends at the start of your next turn and the crown disappears.
  <em>Fey Glamor</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 195) – You lay a glamor upon a touched creature that makes it more interesting, attractive, and compelling. For the duration of the spell, the target has advantage on all Charisma checks.
  <em>Fiendish Brand</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 195) – You infuse a branding iron (typically one bearing the mark of a demon lord or a lord of Hell) with the bone‐chilling cold of the Lower Planes and a promise of damnation. To mark a creature with the brand, you make a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 cold damage to the target and cause it to become branded. The damage can be healed normally, but the brand remains until a remove curse spell is cast on the target, the duration expires, or you use an action to remove the brand. You can remove the brand from any distance, as long as the branded creature is on the same plane of existence as you. While the creature wears the brand, it has disadvantage on any saving throws it makes against spells you cast on it. If you try to locate the creature with a scrying spell, it takes the –10 penalty to its saving throw as if you possessed a lock of its hair or other body part.
  <em>Find Kin</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 195) – You touch one willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an unwilling creature, which is entitled to a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, or automatically if the target is willing, you learn the identity, appearance, and location of one randomly selected living relative of the target.
  <em>Sacrificial Healing</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 242) – You heal another creature’s wounds by taking them upon yourself or transferring them to another willing creature in range. Roll 4d8. The number rolled is the amount of damage healed by the target and the damage you take, as its wounds close and similar damage appears on your body (or the body of the other willing target of the spell).
  <em>Salt Lash</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 242) – You create a long, thin blade of razor‐sharp salt crystals. You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, and any creature struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned by searing pain until the start of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to the blade’s secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures composed mostly of water, such as water elementals, also take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail the saving throw. The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.
  <em>Sand Ship</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 242) – Casting sand ship on a water vessel up to the size of a small sailing ship transforms it into a vessel capable of sailing on sand as easily as water. The vessel still needs a trained crew and relies on wind or oars for propulsion, but it moves at its normal speed across sand instead of water for the duration of the spell. It can sail only over sand, not soil or solid rock. For the duration of the spell, the vessel doesn’t float; it must be beached or resting on the bottom of a body of water (partially drawn up onto a beach, for example) when the spell is cast, or it sinks into the water.
  <em>Sanguine Horror</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 242) – When you cast this spell, you prick yourself with the material component, taking 1 piercing damage. The spell fails if this damage is prevented or negated in any way. From the drop of blood, you conjure a blood elemental (see Creature Codex). The blood elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys verbal commands from you (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the blood elemental, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the blood elemental doesn’t disappear, but you lose control of it and it becomes hostile to you and your companions. An uncontrolled blood elemental cannot be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
  <em>Scale Rot</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 242) – You summon death and decay to plague your enemies. For dragons, this act often takes the form of attacking a foe’s armor and scales, as a way of weakening an enemy dragon and leaving it plagued by self‐doubt and fear. (This enchantment is useful against any armored creature, not just dragons.) One creature of your choice within range that has natural armor must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, attacks against that creature’s Armor Class are made with advantage, and the creature can’t regain hit points through any means while the spell remains in effect. An affected creature can end the spell by making a successful Constitution saving throw, which also makes the creature immune to further castings of scale rot for 24 hours. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of affected targets increases by one for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Paragon Of Chaos</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 232) – You become a humanoid‐shaped swirling mass of color and sound. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. You are also immune to the following conditions: exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious. Finally, you gain truesight to 30 feet and can teleport 30 feet as a move.
  <em>Pendulum</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 232) – You give the touched creature an aspect of regularity in its motions and fortunes. If the target gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, then for the duration of the spell it doesn’t make d20 rolls—to determine the results of attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws it instead follows the sequence 20, 1, 19, 2, 18, 3, 17, 4, and so on.
  <em>Phantom Dragon</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 232) – You tap your dragon magic to make an ally appear as a draconic beast. The target of the spell appears to be a dragon of size Large or smaller. When seeing this illusion, observers make a Wisdom saving throw to see through it.  You can use an action to make the illusory dragon seem ferocious. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the illusory dragon to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature is frightened. The creature remains frightened until it uses an action to make a successful Wisdom saving throw or the spell’s duration expires.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the number of targets the illusion can affect by one for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Phantom Light</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 232) – You touch one object that measures less than 10 feet in every dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. At the time of the casting, you designate up to six creatures. Only those creatures are able to see and gain benefit from the phantom light.  The object can be covered with something opaque to block the light. You can use an action to dismiss this spell.
  <em>Phase Bolt</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 232) – You focus ambient energy into a crackling bolt 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 5d8 force damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.  The bolt passes through the first inanimate object in its path, and creatures on the other side of it receive no benefit from cover. The bolt stops if it strikes a second object.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bolt’s damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Lance Of The Sun God</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 500) – You invoke a lance made of force and light. The lance glows brightly, providing light as a lantern. You are considered proficient with this weapon, and it has the same weapon properties as a nonmagical lance. On a successful melee attack with the lance, you deal 1d12 force damage and 2d8 radiant damage. You can perform a charge attack with the lance. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hit with the lance on the same turn, you double the damage of the attack.
  <em>Smiting Arrow</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – By casting this spell, you imbue a piece of ammunition to have greater effect on a specific target. To this end, you need something directly associated with the creature for which the arrow is intended—a drop of its blood, a strand of its hair, an item of clothing it recently wore, or something similar—which is consumed in the casting of the spell. For the next 24 hours, if the ammunition is used to make a ranged attack against the specific target and it hits, it deals an extra 6d10 radiant damage to the target and stuns it for 1 round. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it takes half as much radiant damage and is not stunned. If the attack is a critical hit, the creature has disadvantage on its saving throw.
  <em>Snap The Leash</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. The beast must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you remove the shackles of domestication from the creature’s mind, causing it to entirely forget being broken or trained. Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any tricks learned and obedience taught. Other memories are not affected, so creatures might remain drawn to those who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated again, but the trainer must start from scratch.  This spell is only partly effective against animal companions, familiars, and paladin mounts. Although the spell removes any tricks such creatures know, the bond between creature and master is otherwise unaffected.
  <em>Snow Boulder</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – A ball of snow forms 5 feet away from you and rolls in the direction you point at a speed of 30 feet, growing larger as it moves. To roll the boulder into a creature, you must make a successful ranged spell attack. If the boulder hits, the creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and take the damage indicated below. Hitting a creature doesn’t stop the snow boulder’s movement or impede its growth, as long as you continue to maintain concentration on the effect. When the spell ends, the boulder stops moving.  Round Size Damage 1 Small 3 Large
  <em>Snow Fort</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – This spell creates a simple “fort” from packed snow. The snow fort springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It encircles a 10‐foot area with sloping walls 4 feet high. The fort provides half cover (+2 AC) against ranged and melee attacks coming from outside the fort. The walls have AC 12, 30 hit points per side, are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are vulnerable to fire damage. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point‐ for‐point basis, up to a maximum of 30 points.  The spell also creates a dozen snowballs that can be thrown (range 20/60) and that deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 cold damage on a hit.
  <em>Snowy Coat</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 1 2023</em> pg 250) – This spell makes a slight alteration to a target creature’s appearance that gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in snowy terrain. In addition, the target can use a bonus action to make itself invisible in snowy terrain for 1 minute. The spell ends at the end of the minute or when the creature attacks or casts a spell.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Flame's Kiss</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 179) – Flames erupt from your hand, burning a creature you try to touch and making it susceptible to further burns. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage, and the next time it takes fire damage before the start of your next turn, the target takes an additional 1d4 fire damage. The spell's damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4) and 17th level (4d4).
  <em>Flames United</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 179) – You create a magical flaming orb that floats over your head. The orb sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. The orb has three charges. When a creature you can see within range takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one of the charges and hurl a magical flame from the orb toward that target. Flames envelop the target, reducing the damage it takes by 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The creature that dealt the damage to the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The radius of light emitted by the orb then decreases by 10 feet. When you expend the last charge, the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the orb has one additional charge for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Flamestep</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 179) – Smoke briefly surrounds you, and you teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Fire or smoke (your choice) bursts out from the space you left. If fire bursts from the space, each creature within 5 feet of that space must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If smoke bursts from that space, a 5-foot-radius sphere of smoke appears centered on that space. The smoke's area is heavily obscured and lasts until the start of your next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell's range and the radius of the smoke each increase by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.
  <em>Flamewalk Portal</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 179) – When you cast this spell, you inscribe a small rune next to a source of fire. The source can be a fireplace, campfire, signal beacon, or other source of fire that is large enough for a Medium creature to stand in the fire. This rune lasts for 30 days, and it remains even if the fire is extinguished. For the duration, when you cast this spell again, you can link any two runes together to form a gateway between the two locations. The two runes linked in this way must be on the same plane of existence, and each rune must have an active fire source within 5 feet of it. While casting this spell, you know if a rune you inscribed has an active fire source within 5 feet of it. For 1 minute or until you end the effect as a bonus action, any creature within 5 feet of one of the fire sources can use 5 feet of its movement to step into that fire source and exit from the other fire source, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the destination fire source. A creature doesn't take fire damage from stepping into the fire. When this effect ends, the runes disappear from both locations, ending the spell if those were the only two runes inscribed with this spell.
  <em>Chamber Of Restoring Amber</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 150) – A 15-foot-radius immobile dome of amber springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave the area. The amber can fit up to twelve Medium or smaller creatures inside of it. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than twelve creatures. Only creatures you designate can enter the dome through an entrance in one of the dome’s walls. All other creatures are barred from entering the amber dome. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the amber or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the amber is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

On a hit, the creature’s Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4, and it is afflicted with the seeping death disease for the duration.

  <em>Effervesce Sense</em> (Transmutation Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 174) – You transform one sensory organ of a willing creature you touch. Choose one of the target’s sensory organs (eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or skin). In a blur of magical bubbles that inflate and pop around it, the chosen organ transforms into the corresponding organ of an animal, enhancing the associated sense (sight for eyes, smell for nose, taste for mouth, hearing for ears, and touch for skin). For example, a pair of transformed eyes might become like a chameleon’s or owl’s, while transformed skin might become covered in millions of tiny hairs like those on a spider or the skin of the target’s hand might become exceptionally fleshy like a star-nosed mole’s nose. Once before the spell ends, the target can grant itself advantage on one Wisdom (Perception) check of its choice using that sense. The spell then ends. At the GM’s discretion, this advantage can be applied to a different ability check related to the chosen sensory organ, such as a rogue gaining advantage on a thieves’ tools check while listening to the tumblers within a lock the rogue is picking. This spell has no effect on a creature with a naturally strong sense, such as a badger’s already-enhanced smell from its Keen Smell trait (though this spell can be used to enhance the badger’s sight or hearing).

  <em>Elemental Exchange</em> (3rd-Level Transmutation <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 174) – You twist the elemental properties of a spell, breath weapon, or other effect utilizing elemental energies to shift from its current element into another. The creature causing the triggering spell or effect (such as a red dragon’s Fire Breath, an ankheg’s Acid Spray, a kraken’s Lightning Storm, the cone of cold spell, or similar) must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the damage the effect deals changes to one of the following damage types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
  <em>Elemental Infusion</em> (1st-level transmutation <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 174) – You infuse an ally’s weapon with the power of the elements.

The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. If a creature within the mist takes lightning damage, the mist immediately disperses, ending this spell, and the lightning damage spreads to other creatures in the mist. Each creature within the mist, other than the creature that took the lightning damage, must make a Constitution saving throw, taking the same amount of lightning damage that the triggering creature took on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  <em>Confound Senses</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 154) – This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures that you can see within range, causing the creatures to see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage. Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom (Survival) checks to avoid getting lost. Whenever an affected creature must choose between one or more paths, it chooses at random and immediately forgets which direction it came from.
  <em>Conjure Ferryman</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 154) – When standing on a riverbank or on the shore of some other body of water, you summon a ferry spirit and its boat, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.

It takes you and up to 1 companion per your level across the river or body of water (no action required by you) or to other locations along the same water. If you don’t issue any such commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its guide don’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the conjured spirit, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled ferryman can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. The GM has the ferry spirit’s statistics, using the statistics of a bearded devil.
  <em>Conjure Giant</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 154) – You summon a giant of challenge rating 6 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The giant disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The giant is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the giant, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you) as long as your commands don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the giant, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. If your concentration is broken, the giant doesn’t disappear, but instead, you lose control of it: the giant becomes hostile toward you and your companions and might attack. An uncontrolled giant can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after summoned. The GM has the giant’s statistics.
  <em>Bouncing Fireball</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 145) – A bolt of flame streaks from your finger toward a point you choose within range, then explodes into an inferno. Each creature within 20 feet of the explosion takes 7d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Immediately afterward, a second bolt of flame streaks from that explosion to a second target point you can see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion. It explodes again at the second target point, causing another 7d6 fire damage (halved by a successful Dexterity saving throw). Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final time with identical results. Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst, the burst fails to happen and the spell ends immediately.
  <em>Break It Down</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 145) – You sing or play a tune that fills creatures that can hear the tune with unrestrained energy. Each creature of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target must use its reaction to throw one object or creature it is holding, which can include a grappled creature, or pick up and throw the nearest object within its reach if it isn’t holding anything. An object the same size or smaller than the thrower is thrown up to 30 feet in a random direction. A creature the same size as the thrower is thrown up to 15 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a creature is smaller than the thrower, the creature is thrown an additional 10 feet for each size category of difference between it and the thrower. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is a creature and is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. A creature or object larger than the thrower can’t be thrown.
  <em>Breath Of Separation</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 145) – You exhale a massive volume of air, propelling yourself up to 15 feet in a direction of your choosing to an unoccupied space you can see. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the space you just left must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from your original space. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. If a pushed creature strikes a solid surface, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If a pushed creature is pushed into another creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
  <em>Breeze Walker</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 145) – Choosing a direction, you summon a strong, steady breeze to swirl beneath your feet and propel you. You levitate to a sustained height of 3 feet for the duration, and travel in the chosen direction at 150% of your movement. Travel in any other direction is at 50% of your movement. While mounted, your mount’s movement is affected as well.
  <em>Lost</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 195) – You attempt to confuse and confound a creature’s sense of direction. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the spell removes all memory of particular locations, landmarks, and routes for the duration of the spell, even well-known ones such as locations within a city, a home forest, and well-known hills and roads. A remove curse or greater restoration spell ends this effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
  <em>Lost And Wandering</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 195) – As the lost spell (see above), and in addition to forgetting all navigation skills and landmarks, the target is compelled to wander off at a walk (attacking only in self-defense). After 16 hours, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls into an exhausted long rest. A remove curse or greater restoration spell ends this effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, a target experiences the spell for 48 hours, making the Wisdom saving throw after 24 hours instead of after 16 hours. If you use a spell slot of 9th level or higher, a target experiences this spell for 7 days, making the Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours instead of after 16 hours.
  <em>Lunar Transfer</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 195) – This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice that you can see within range to a destination you select. If you target an unwilling creature, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and you appear in the target location instead. A transferred creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether the creature or object arrives there successfully. The GM rolls a d20 and consults the Lunar Transfer table below. • Grove or Magic Circle means a hallowed druid grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. • Memento means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb. • Very Familiar is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. • Seen Casually is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. • Viewed Once is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. • Description is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map. • False Destination is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. The target creature or object appears where you want it to. Off Target. The target creature or object appears a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a d20 roll, though never more than half the distance traveled. For example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed

Your spell imbues each target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as a plague zombie. The plague zombie uses the game statistics of a zombie, except each time the plague zombie hits with a Slam attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take poison damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and contract the cackle fever or sewer plague disease (your choice). As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any plague zombie you animated with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple plague zombies, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the plague zombie will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The plague zombie is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four plague zombies you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

The shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling. All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain. If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself from the tendrils. Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 10-foot cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as at least one 10-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature's space, the creature remains restrained.

Targeted. You spray a jet of caustic bile at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 acid damage and is poisoned until it, or another creature within reach of it, uses an action to wipe off the bile.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the circle’s radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 3rd.

When you cast this spell, you blow gently on the rosette, sending a stream of glowing seeds at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 radiant damage. Until the spell ends, you can blow on the rosette and make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Radiant Shield</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 211) – You channel divine power into a shield you are wielding and throw it at a target you can see within range.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the shield can bounce to one additional target for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the subsequent targets must be within 20 feet of the first target.

  <em>Raise Elder</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 211) – This spell is identical to raise dead, but it works only on a creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less potent than a wish can restore these lost points. In all other respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the added year elapses. Raise elder has no effect if it’s cast on the same creature a second time.

Each target switches places with one other target, teleporting out of its current space and into the other target’s space and vice versa. The two targets must be within one size category of each other. A creature can’t be teleported into damaging terrain or into a space it can’t ordinarily occupy. For example, a creature that can’t fly can’t switch places with a flying creature that is in the air, but two creatures that can fly can be switched, regardless if one is in the air. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.

As part of casting this spell or as a bonus action on a subsequent turn but before your next long rest, you can consume this stolen hour of time. Alternatively, you can gift the time to a friendly creature you can see within range. As a bonus action at any point before your next long rest, that creature can consume the stolen time. A creature that consumes the stolen hour of time can expend Hit Dice to regain hit points as if it had completed a short rest. The creature doesn’t gain any other benefits of a short rest. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and ages the target an additional hour for each slot level above 2nd. The stolen time can be shared with multiple creatures and must be used in 1-hour increments.
  <em>Mighty Vessel</em> (8th-Level Conjuration <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 199) – A wooden warship rises from an area of water of your choice that you can see within range. The area of water must be large enough to accommodate the boat, at least 100 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 15 feet deep, and it must be clear of any other boats or structures.

An arguing creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If an arguing creature starts its turn with no other creature within 30 feet of it with which to argue, the spell ends for that creature. Otherwise, the spell ends for all creatures if an affected creature takes damage.
  <em>Conjure Rats</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 155) – You summon rats or ratfolk that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears: • One mildly hostile wererat (CR 2), which does not obey your verbal commands but might defend itself. • One ratfolk rogue (see Tome of Beasts) (CR 1). • Four swarms of rats or four ratfolk (see Tome of Beasts) (CR 1/4). • Eight giant rats (CR 1/8). • Sixteen normal rats (CR 0). Each rat disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned rats are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned rats as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you), except the wererat. If you don’t issue any commands, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures’ statistics. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using higher-level spell slots, you can choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: one additional creature with a 2nd-level slot or three additional creatures with a 4th-level slot. Any summoned wererats obey verbal commands.
  <em>Conjure Shadow Titan</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 155) – You summon a shadow titan, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The shadow titan disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The shadow titan is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the shadow titan; it acts on its own turn. It obeys verbal or telepathic commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the shadow titan, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the shadow titan’s statistics, using a stone giant, except its Stone Camouflage works in dim light and darkness rather than rocky terrain, and the rocks it throws are composed of shadow stuff and cause cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
  <em>Conjure Spellhound</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 155) – You summon a spellhound, a Large hound with a shimmering, multihued coat, in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spellhound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spellhound is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the spellhound, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. While you control the spellhound, you and your companions are immune to the spellhound’s Nullifying Howl. If your concentration is broken, the spellhound doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the spellhound, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled spellhound can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. The GM has the spellhound’s statistics, using a spellhound (see Tome of Beasts 2) or a winter wolf with the following action: Nullifying Howl (1/Day). The spellhound lets out a high-pitched, multiphonic howl to disrupt magical effects within 60 feet of it. Any spell of 3rd level or lower within the area ends. For each spell of 4th-level or higher in the area, the spellhound makes an ability check, adding its Constitution modifier to the roll. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell ends. In addition, each spellcaster within 30 feet of the spellhound that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, more spellhounds appear: two with a 6th-level slot and three with an 8th-level slot.
  <em>Elf Shot</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 175) – You pretend to shoot an arrow with a tiny bow. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target creature stumbles (is pushed) 5 feet in a random direction (roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face), and its speed is 0 until the end of its next turn. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
  <em>El’Tharyn's Evanishing Exchange</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 175) – A brief flash of sparkling, red light surrounds one object you are holding that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object vanishes and instantly appears in the free hand of one willing creature you can see within range. If the object can be used, such as a potion, the creature can then take the Use an Object action as a reaction on the object you sent to it. This spell fails if the target doesn’t have at least one free hand to receive the object.
  <em>Emotional Gamut</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 175) – You force a creature you can see within range to experience a rush of emotions and powerful memories from its life. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become overwhelmed with emotions as it recalls emotionally charged events from its life for the duration. While overwhelmed with emotions, the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes on its turn. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can’t be charmed. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage. On a success, the spell ends.
  <em>Encroaching Shadows</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 175) – You cause menacing shadows to invade an area 200 feet on a side and 50 feet high, centered on a point within range. Illumination in the area drops one step (from bright light to dim, or from dim light to darkness). Any spell that creates light in the area that is cast using a lower- level spell slot than was used to cast encroaching shadows is dispelled, and a spell that creates light doesn’t function in the area if that spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or lower. Nonmagical effects can’t increase the level of illumination in the affected area. A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in the area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than the spell slot actually used.  Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell’s duration increases by 12 hours, and it cannot be dispelled by a spell that creates light, even if that spell is cast using a higher-level spell slot.
  <em>Enshroud</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 175) – You create a massive blanket of heavy fog that covers the area within 500 feet of you for the duration. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. After you create it, the fog drifts along like a normal bank of fog and doesn’t remain centered on you. When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures to be unaffected by it. A creature in the fog or a creature looking into the fog from the outside can’t see more than 60 feet in the fog. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses the fog after 1 minute.
  <em>Servant Of Doom</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 217) – A force of destruction gifts you a portion of its power. Each time you cast this spell, you choose whether to assume the form of the emissary or the form of the envoy for the duration.  Emissary. The blood in your veins shines through your skin, extra eyes open in your flesh, and you gain the following benefits: • You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover, though you must stay within 5 feet of the ground. • You gain truesight out to a range of 60 feet. • Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells and abilities. • You have advantage on Intelligence- or Wisdom-based attack rolls.  Envoy. Your skin becomes stonelike, bony growths erupt across your body, and you gain the following benefits: • You ignore difficult terrain for movement purposes. • You can move through walls and other solid barriers if you succeed on a Strength check you make just before moving up to the barrier. The DC equals 10 + twice the barrier’s thickness in feet. • You have advantage on Strength- or Dexterity-based attack rolls. • Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit.
  <em>Shackle</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 217) – You magically tether a Large or smaller creature you can see within range to the ground. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be magically bound to a point of your choice within 5 feet of it until the start of your next turn. While magically bound, the target can’t move more than 5 feet away from that point. If the target is an Undead, it has disadvantage on the saving throw and takes radiant damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
  <em>Shadow Adaptation</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 217) – Your flesh and clothing pale and become faded as your body takes on a tiny fragment of the Plane of Shadow. For the duration of this spell, you are immune to shadow corruption (see Book of Ebon Tides) and have resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that reduce your Strength score or hit point maximum, such as a shadow’s Strength Drain or the harm spell.
  <em>Shadow Armor</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 217) – You can siphon energy from the Plane of Shadow to protect yourself from an immediate threat. As a reaction, you pull shadows around yourself to distort reality. The attack against you is made with disadvantage, and you have resistance to radiant damage until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Shadow Bite</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 217) – You create a momentary needle of cold, sharp pain in a creature within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage immediately and have its speed halved until the start of your next turn. This spell’s damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 5th level, 3d6 when you reach 11th level, and 4d6 when you reach 17th level.
  <em>Unstoppable Moon</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 233) – You create a 15-foot-diameter sphere of moonrock that slams down in an unoccupied space you can see within range and lasts for the duration. Each creature within 10 feet of that space when you first create the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage and 5d10 radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and 2d10 radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. The sphere stops moving only if you ram it into a Huge or larger creature, but a creature can be affected by the sphere only once on each of your turns, regardless of how many times you roll the sphere into it. When you move the sphere, you can direct it to roll over barriers up to 10 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 20 feet wide.
  <em>Uplifting Spirit</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 233) – You conjure the spirit of a lost loved one or ancestor to protect your mind from harm. The spirit exudes a sense of calm reassurance and quiet strength. Until the spell ends, each friendly creature within 15 feet of you, including you, can’t be frightened and has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot above 5th. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is 8 hours. Using a spell slot of 7th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.
  <em>Uplifting Spirit, A Tribute To David Hanson</em> (nan <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 233) – On the day that I was planning to write my spell, I woke up to a call telling me that my dad had died. Dad wasn’t a gamer, but with his love of westerns I think he would have understood the desire for adventure and daring deeds. “My friend, I do not know what else I shall leave my son, but if I have left him a love of language, of literature, a taste for Homer, for the poets, the people who have told our story—and by ‘our’ I mean the story of mankind—then he will have legacy enough.” Louis L’Amour, The Lonesome Gods We will miss you, Dad. You will be remembered.
  <em>Reshape Skeleton</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 214) – You cause one creature you can see to suffer a bone-cracking rearrangement of its skeleton. Choose one creature you can see within range that has a bony or cartilaginous skeletal structure. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw or its bone structure becomes mutable for the duration. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to adjust the target’s bone structure, limiting its ability to act. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage and suffer one of the following effects of your choice until the end of its next turn: halved speed or disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
  <em>Rift</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 214) – You conjure a small rift to another plane on a point you can see within range. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following natures. The rift exhibits the chosen nature for the duration. Chaos. The rift’s presence warps the area around it, disorienting nearby creatures. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the rift has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the start of its next turn, and when it moves on its turn, it moves in a random direction. Delights. Soothing lights and sounds float out from the rift. Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the rift regains hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and can’t be frightened until the start of its next turn. Horrors. Tentacles erupt from the rift and fly toward up to three creatures you can see within 20 feet of the rift. Each creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained. If no creatures are restrained by the rift’s tentacles at the end of your turn, the next creature, other than you, to move within 20 feet of the rift must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles for the duration.
  <em>Investiture Of Blight</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 190) – Ghostly spirits emerge from your body and whirl around you. Your body emits dim light in a 15-foot radius for the spell’s duration.

  <em>Jedza's Tidy Charmj</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 190) – Your touch imbues a container with a temporary pocket dimension. The container then animates, attempting to collect nearby objects in its pocket dimension. At the start of each of your turns, the container moves up to 30 feet and collects each object that isn’t being worn or carried and weighs 15 pounds or less along its path. You can choose the container’s path (no action required) or the container can move at random. The collected objects disappear into the container’s pocket dimension for the duration. The container is a Tiny object that can be attacked and destroyed. It has an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier. If the container is destroyed, the spell ends. When the spell ends, all objects within the container are expelled harmlessly in a heap in the container’s space, potentially burying the container if it isn’t tipped over into something else first.
  <em>Jerilyn's Cadaverous Uprising</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 190) – Specify a 5-foot-square space of natural ground (not solid stone) that you can see within range, then choose any undead creature of challenge rating 1 or lower (such as a specter, ghoul, shadow, zombie, or skeleton). That creature claws its way up out of the ground and immediately tries to grapple or attack a creature within 5 feet. The undead uses its standard stat block, but it has only 10 hit points and is prone until it stands up. It takes its turn immediately after yours. You can use a bonus action to issue a mental command to the undead when you cast the spell, and you can change the command by using a bonus action on your turn while the spell is active. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. If you issue no command, the creature defends itself and attacks the last enemy that attacked it. The creature remains under your control for 1 hour, after which it crumbles to dust or disappears. At Higher Levels. The number of undead you summon increases when you cast this spell with a higher-level spell slot: two when cast with a 5th-level slot, three with a 7th-level slot, and four with a 9th-level slot.
  <em>Kel's Antlion Trap</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 190) – You summon three sandpits on the ground on points you can see within range. Each pit is 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep and is difficult terrain. A creature that enters a pit for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the sand. A creature restrained by a sandpit takes 2d6 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature restrained by a sandpit can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Baba's Pincushion</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 140) – You conjure a torrent of serrated darts that fly toward a target within range, puncturing and pinning it. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d4 piercing damage and is pinned to the ground or another surface within 5 feet of the target, such as a wall, tree, or similar, for 1 minute. While pinned to the ground or to a surface heavier than it, the target is restrained. The restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. While pinned to a surface that is lighter than it, such as a chair or saddle, the target’s speed is halved, but it isn’t restrained. The target can use an action to extricate itself from such a surface. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Balo's Bolster Dead</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 140) – Necrotic energy flows out from you, bolstering your Undead allies. Each friendly Undead within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier for 8 hours. If you expend your life force when you cast this spell, you can increase the temporary hit points each target gains. Expend and roll a number of Hit Dice of your choice up to half your maximum Hit Dice. Each target of this spell increases the temporary hit points it gains by that amount. Hit Dice spent in this way can’t be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.
  <em>Bark Bulwark</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 140) – A nonmagical wall of bark erupts from the ground to protect you and your allies. Choose a space in front of or behind you. The wall forms in that space, extending 15 feet out from that space along the ground in opposite directions for a total length of 30 feet. The wall is 5 feet high, 6 inches thick, opaque, and provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). The wall can’t otherwise occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall must be vertical and must rest on a firm foundation, such as the ground, the floor of a building, the deck of a ship, or similar. The wall is an object made of bark that can be damaged and thus breached. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 100 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys it. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.
  <em>Bartholomew's Elemental Arc</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 140) – You become a living conduit of elemental energy. The friendly target doesn’t take the triggering damage, as you draw the elemental energy into yourself and toward a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes half the triggering damage, and you take the other half. On a miss, you take half the triggering damage. On a critical hit, the target takes all the triggering damage, and you take none. After the attack, regardless if it hits or misses, you gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn.
  <em>Charm Of Long Standing</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 151) – This spell functions as charm person but with a longer duration. The target of the spell remains charmed for one day per level you’ve attained in your spellcasting class. In addition, so long as the target remains charmed by you, you are also charmed by the target. While you’re charmed this way, you won’t tolerate any harm, abuse, or mistreatment being directed toward the spell’s target.
  <em>Charnel Banquet</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 151) – This spell transforms a field of carrion to an empowering feast. For the duration, all creatures of your choice can consume the decaying flesh of any creature. When the spell’s duration elapses, if a creature has eaten carrion for the entirety, it recovers 10d6 hit points, recovers half its expended Hit Dice (minimum 1), removes half its levels of exhaustion (minimum 1), and gains all the benefits of finishing a short rest. Creatures affected by this spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of the duration or be poisoned for 1 hour.
  <em>Chergui's Swift Blessing</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 151) – You ensorcel a Medium vehicle powered by wind, increasing its speed by 10 feet or 1 mile per hour (whichever is most appropriate for the vehicle) for the duration. In addition, until this spell ends, the pilot of the vehicle can use an action to turn the vehicle up to 90 degrees, quickly changing the vehicle’s direction.
  <em>Chittrk’K's Soul Fire</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 151) – You summon a bit of greenish fire to the top of your head, into one hand, or at the tip of your tail. It flares brightly, and all creatures that see your soul fire must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature seeks to follow the light, even into areas of bright light or darkness or into shallow water. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
  <em>Field Of Lotuses</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 178) – A field of magical lotus flowers sprouts in a 20-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range. Each creature in the spell’s area has immunity to psychic damage. A creature that spends 10 minutes in the area is cured of all diseases and poison and reduces its exhaustion level by 1. A creature that spends a short rest in the area regains the maximum hit points from any Hit Die it expends to recover hit points during the short rest. After the creature has spent at least 10 minutes in the area, it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
  <em>Field Of Retribution</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 178) – You fill creatures with a desire for retribution. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of a point you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with a desire for retribution. While cursed, a creature must move to and attack the nearest creature it can see on its turn. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the target moves as close as it can to the nearest creature then attacks itself in frustration. At the end of each of its turns, a cursed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
  <em>Fire Dance</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 178) – You dance and twirl two sources of fire in a rapid pattern that leaves glowing trails. Creatures of your choice in the area that see your fire dance must make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, a target becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. The spell ends if you are incapacitated.
  <em>Fist From Hell</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 178) – You create an arcane speck of light above a creature you can see within range. The speck turns into a portal from which a massive fiendish fist strikes down on the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Flame's Chronicle Unleashed</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 178) – You draw on the power of a historic fire, drought, or heat wave that happened within the past 100 years within 1 mile of you. You then release the condensed memory of that event in a blast that erupts in a 30-foot radius from you. When you cast this spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to be unaffected by it. The blast causes one of the following effects of your choice: Desiccate. Nearby water rapidly evaporates, including the water within creatures. A body or container of water in the spell’s area that fills a 10-foot cube or less evaporates instantly, including water in containers that are being worn or carried by creatures in the area. Each creature in the spell’s area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures made mostly of water, such as water elementals, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Swelter. The temperature of the air around you rises dramatically. Each creature in the spell’s area must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering 2 levels of exhaustion on a failed save, or only 1 level of exhaustion on a successful one.
  <em>Hand Of Doom</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 185) – Your outstretched hand glows with sinister power that hastens the demise of a creature you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 necrotic damage and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of your next turn. If the target was already poisoned when you hit it with hand of doom, it takes 1d12 poison damage instead of 1d4 necrotic damage on a failed save. This spell’s damage increases by one die at 5th level (2d4 necrotic or 2d12 poison), 11th level (3d4 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d4 or 4d12).
  <em>Harfang's Hoarfrost</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 185) – Crackling ice coats a ranged weapon you touch. When you make a ranged weapon attack with that weapon during the spell’s duration, the ammunition becomes wreathed in frost. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 cold damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. The spell lasts for the duration or until you make six ranged weapon attacks with the weapon. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack with the weapon before the spell ends for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Harmful Exchange</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 185) – As a creature attacks you, you swap places with another creature you can see within range, forcing that creature to take a blow intended for you. If the target of the swap is unwilling, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to avoid the effect. When you swap places with a creature, you are teleported to the that creature’s space as it is teleported to yours, and that creature becomes the new target of the triggering attack. You can’t swap places with a creature more than one size category larger than you. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell’s range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Healing Glyph</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 185) – When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or upon an object that can be carried (such as a book, a shield, a belt pouch, or a similar item). The glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 5 inches in diameter. If the glyph is not triggered before you finish a long rest, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends. The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the surface on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, the most common triggers include touching that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Beasts or humans), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical restorative energy in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area that isn’t a Construct or Undead can choose one of the following effects: • Healing. The creature regains 3d8 hit points. • Restoration. The creature is cured of one disease or one of the following conditions of its choice: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
  <em>Dance Of The Fey</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 160) – You conjure fey energies around the creature that moved close to you. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you and the creature are teleported to unoccupied spaces you can see within 10 feet of where you each started, and the creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn, but neither of you are teleported.
  <em>Dark Dementing</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 160) – A dark shadow creeps across the target’s mind and leaves a small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or darkness, the creature must either move toward bright light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light spell, or the like).
  <em>Dark Path</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 160) – You conjure a shadowy road between two points within range to create a bridge or path. This effect can bridge a chasm or create a smooth path through difficult terrain. The dark path is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight at one time. A creature that adds more weight than the path can support sinks through the path as if it didn’t exist.
  <em>Darkbolt</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 160) – You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.
  <em>Dash Of The Sentinel</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 160) – You magically launch yourself forward. You move up to 100 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. The first time you enter a creature’s space during this move, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 force damage and is knocked prone if it is your size or smaller. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. When you move through a creature’s space, you can choose to not affect it.
  <em>Power Word Plague</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You speak a word of power, infecting a creature within range that can see and hear you with a virulent disease. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it contracts the disease. In addition, choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier within 30 feet of the target. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or also contract the disease. These secondary targets can have any hit point total. While diseased, a target suffers the following effects: • At the start of each of its turns, the target’s hit point maximum decreases by 20. • The target can’t regain hit points, except by magical spells higher than 5th level. • The target’s speed is halved. The disease ends on a creature when the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. The disease can also be ended by a greater restoration, heal, or wish spell.
  <em>Power Word Rebound</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You utter a word of power as a weapon or spell hits a creature you can see within range. The attack rebounds on the attacker, using all the same attack and damage rolls against the attacker.
  <em>Power Word Rend</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You speak a word of power that causes the internal organs of a creature you can see within range to rupture. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d6 + 20 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is below half its hit point maximum, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. This spell has no effect on creatures without vital internal organs, such as Constructs, Oozes, and Undead. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Power Word Reveal</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You utter a word of power and every creature within range perceives things as they actually are. Each creature within 120 feet of you has truesight in the spell’s area until the start of your next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Power Word Vulnerability</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You utter a word of power and one creature you can see within range becomes vulnerable to one of the following damage types of your choice: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. If the target is normally immune to the chosen damage type, it has resistance to that type of damage instead. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this vulnerability ends.
  <em>Pratfall</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 209) – You cause a small bit of bad luck to befall a creature, making it look humorously foolish. When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause one creature you can see within range to experience one of the following effects. A creature can experience only one of these effects at a time. Clothing Malfunction. An invisible force sharply tugs on the target’s trousers, causing their clothing to slip. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes with a two-handed weapon or it loses its shield bonus to its AC (your choice) until the end of its next turn as it uses one hand to gather itself. Disorienting Clap. The target feels the sensation of a quick, mild clap against its ears, briefly disorienting it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it can’t cast spells with somatic components until the end of its next turn. Flash of Lights. Strobing lights flash briefly before your target’s eyes, causing difficulties with its vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its passive Perception is halved until the end of its next turn. Slippery Floor. A small, oily puddle appears under the target’s feet, causing it to lose balance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be unable to use bonus actions on its next turn as it regains its footing and balance. Sneezing Fit. Tiny particles blow in your target’s face, causing it to sneeze. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
  <em>Moonlight Sending</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 201) – You exhort a fiend to attack a distant foe. After the offering is made, roll a d20 and add your spellcasting ability modifier, then consult the following table to determine which fiend is summoned: 1–4 Sending fails — 9–12 Rattok demon (see Creature Codex) 3–4 or bearded devil 17–20 Lunar devil (see Tome of Beasts) 8 or hezrou Once summoned, you must make a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to compel the fiend to seek out a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. On a success, the fiend slinks off to its target, usually but not always by night. On a failure, the fiend refuses, and the offering and the bowl are consumed in the casting. The conjured fiend may find that the target is warded or inaccessible or simply difficult to find (whether because of invisibility or some other reason). In this case, you must make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the fiend returns and demands no further offering, reports its failure, and vanishes. On a failure, the fiend returns and demands another offering. If this is not immediately forthcoming, it attacks you.
  <em>Moonsphere Meteor</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 201) – You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of moonrock that slams down on a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause the moonrock to appear and slam down on a point you can see within range again. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage or radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Doom Of Stacked Stones</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 168) – You and three creatures of your choice within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained. If one of the three targeted creatures fails this saving throw, as many as two other creatures (per initial target), each within 30 feet of the initial target, must make the same save. A restrained creature must continue to make saving throws each turn, and their condition worsens on a failure, as follows: Creatures turned to stone can see, hear, and smell normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is cast on a stone creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed. Creatures transformed into stone can be restored with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.
  <em>Doom Of Summer Years</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 168) – You rapidly reduce the age of your target. Choose a living creature within range. At the time the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns, your target must make a Constitution saving throw, decreasing 1d4 + 1 years in age on a successful save or 1 year on a failed one. A target ceases the de-aging process once it is reduced to infancy. A creature that is reduced in age retains all of its memories, ability scores, and features, but it gains 1 level of exhaustion for each 5 years it is reduced in age. A Medium creature reduced to childhood cannot use weapons with the heavy property. A Medium creature reduced to infancy cannot wield weapons or use tools. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reverts to its true age. Otherwise, the targets is permanently reduced to its new age. Remove curse and greater restoration can be used to return a creature to its true age. If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the spell, you gain levels in exhaustion equal to what the target gained from this spell.
  <em>Forgettable</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 181) – You and up to two other willing creatures you can see within range are surrounded by a magical field that prevents others from forming concrete memories of you. Until the spell ends, a creature that interacts with a target for less than 1 minute and in a way that isn’t impactful remembers the target only passingly and with only vague details. An impactful interaction includes combat, being loud in a quiet crowd, or other interaction that might be particularly memorable, such as being the only person in drab, brown clothing at a noble’s extravagant, colorful ball. At the GM’s discretion, other interactions might be impactful to a creature based on that creature’s personality, occupation, or other factors, such as a target giving a gold coin to a beggar who hasn’t eaten in days. The spell causes brief, non-impactful interactions with the targets to be fleeting, vague memories. It doesn’t change a target’s appearance or create any other form of disguise that might help a target avoid notice.
  <em>Frailform</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 181) – You blast a creature within range with a beam of pure, entropic energy that ages it rapidly. The target takes 4d6 necrotic damage and must make a successful Constitution saving throw; on a failure, its Strength and Dexterity are both reduced to 1. While its Strength and Dexterity are reduced in this way, the creature can’t hold weapons weighing more than 3 pounds, its speed is halved, and it can’t take reactions. The creature’s Armor Class and attack rolls are modified to account for its reduced attributes. The creature can cast spells normally. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw after it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by greater restoration, wish, or comparable magic.
  <em>Frightful Shout</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 181) – When casting this spell, you let out a terrible yell toward a creature you can see within range. If the target has an alignment opposed to yours (good/evil, lawful/chaotic) and it can hear you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t frightened.
  <em>Galvanize Metal</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 181) – Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to electrify. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 1d8 lightning damage when you cast the spell and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this effect again. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to part with the object.
  <em>Busy Bee</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 148) – You summon a spirit that animates the bee carving for up to 8 hours, which attaches to your clothing, sits on your equipment, or otherwise remains within 1 foot of you. If the bee is ever more than 1 foot away from you, this spell ends. When you lose concentration on a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spirit animating the bee takes over and maintains concentration on that spell until that spell ends or this spell ends, whichever has a shorter duration. While the spirit is maintaining concentration on a spell, you can’t cast a spell that requires concentration. The spirit can’t be attacked or destroyed, and its concentration can’t be interrupted. You can dismiss this spell at any time (no action required), and a dispel magic spell cast on the bee, if successful, ends this spell.
  <em>By The Light Of The Moon</em> (2 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 148) – The area within 30 feet of you becomes bathed in magical moonlight. In addition to providing dim light, it highlights objects and locations that are hidden or that hold a useful clue. Until the spell ends, all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made in the area are made with advantage.
  <em>By The Light Of The Watchful Moon</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 148) – Regardless of the time of day or your location, you command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats to you and your allies. Shafts of bright moonlight, each 5 feet wide, shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all spaces within range that contain threats, whether they are enemies, traps, or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s glow. The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location (somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues to illuminate any target that moves, but a target that moves out of the spell’s area is no longer illuminated. A threat that enters the area after the spell is cast is not subject to the spell’s effect.
  <em>Call Shadow Mastiff</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 148) – You tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow and conjure a large dog made of pure shadow in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The shadow mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the mastiff, which has its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, the mastiff defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the shadow mastiff ’s statistics, using a dire wolf, except it is a Monstrosity, it doubles its proficiency bonus when making Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and it has the Bay action and the Shadow Stealth bonus action, both of which are described below: Bay. The shadow mastiff uses an action to release a terrifying howl. Each creature within a 30-foot cone of the mastiff must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the mastiff by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Bay of shadow mastiffs for the next 24 hours. Shadow Stealth. As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, the mastiff takes the Hide action.
  <em>Ashen Lashes</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 139) – You create two tendrils of magical ash to appear in unoccupied spaces within range. The tendrils can’t be targeted with attacks and are immune to damage. When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can command one or more of the tendrils to attack a creature within 10 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for each tendril using your spellcasting ability modifier. On a hit, a tendril deals 1d4 fire damage to the target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can creature one additional tendril for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Aura Of Entropy</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 139) – Sickening energy radiates out from you in a sphere with a 30-foot radius. While the spell lasts, the sphere remains centered on you and moves with you. Each hostile creature in the sphere has disadvantage on saving throws against becoming frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. Creatures in the sphere can’t gain temporary hit points, and any effect that restores hit points to a creature within the sphere has those hit points reduced by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).
  <em>Aura Of Filth</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 139) – Putrefying energy radiates in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature in the aura, including you, has disadvantage on saving throws against poison and disease and on death saving throws. In addition, each creature in the aura can’t be cured of a disease or poison, except by means of a heal or wish spell. Dying or decaying material within the aura, such as corpses, picked flowers, or food, rapidly putrefy, decaying an additional day for each round it is in the aura. This effect increases the amount of time a corpse has been dead, counting against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.
  <em>Azalea Skin</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 139) – Dozens of azaleas blossom on your skin. Until this spell ends, if a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 1d6 poison damage. If a creature within 5 feet of you scores a critical hit against you, the azaleas release a burst of poisonous pollen. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn. The spell then ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.
  <em>Horn Of Heroes</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 189) – You summon the spirits of ancient heroes that take the form of up to three Humanoids of challenge rating 5 or lower and appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Each Humanoid disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The Humanoids are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned Humanoids as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you), as long as the commands don’t violate their alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the Humanoids, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.  The GM has the Humanoids’ statistics.
  <em>Illusion Of Health I</em> (Illusion Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 189) – An illusion of yourself in your usual state of health and condition overlays your current form. This illusion doesn’t exaggerate your usual state of health, but it conceals wounds, injuries, and any symptoms of disease or poison, including marks, tears, or stains on your clothing or armor. This illusion changes no other facet of your appearance; it simply presents you and your worn equipment in a healthy, whole state. You aren’t healed of any damage or cured of any disease, and any symptoms or effects from your conditions or ailments continue, such as a cough from a disease or the smell of blood if you are actively bleeding.
  <em>Immolating Geist</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 189) – A Medium spectral humanoid engulfed in ghostly flames appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the flaming spirit up to 20 feet. The spirit can enter the space of another creature and can pass through objects, such as walls, provided you can see the destination space. A creature that starts its turn in the spirit’s space must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Impaling Glory</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 189) – You call down glowing spears to skewer and pin your enemies. The golden spears fall on up to three creatures on the ground you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against each target. On a hit, a creature takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 radiant damage and is restrained as the glowing spear pierces it and pins it to the ground. A creature restrained by a spear can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the piercing damage or radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Infernal Rebound</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 189) – A creature that damaged you is temporarily engulfed in infernal flames. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage and be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the target is pushed an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Dimensional Shove</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 164) – This spell pushes a creature you touch through a dimensional portal, causing it to disappear and then reappear a short distance away. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it disappears from its current location and reappears 30 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or other solid surfaces, but the target can’t reappear inside a solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel.
  <em>Discord</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 164) – You disrupt the harmony between up to three creatures you can see within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become hostile to each other target until the start of your next turn. Until the spell ends, targets that failed the saving throw can’t help each other, target each other with beneficial spells or effects, or similarly work together on their turns. At the GM’s discretion, the creatures might attack each other, might compete for the tastiest among you and your friends, or similarly act against each other.
  <em>Disrupting Orb</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 164) – You call upon the power of the Plane of Shadow and create a 20-foot-radius sphere of strobing light and shadow centered on a point you can see within range. A creature that starts its turn in the area and can see the strobing effect must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to make more than one attack on its turn, and it is unable to use bonus actions or reactions until the start of its next turn. If the creature that failed the save is maintaining concentration on a spell, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration. As a bonus action, you can move the orb up to 30 feet.
  <em>Diversion Door</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 164) – Your touch wards an arch, doorway, entryway, or other threshold against intruders. For the duration of the spell, each time a creature attempts to cross the warded threshold, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is redirected away from the threshold as if it had passed through the threshold from the other side, and it forgets its primary, intended course of action in relation to the threshold, such as obtaining an object or chasing a creature on the other side of the threshold, for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature is redirected away from the threshold, but it doesn’t forget its primary, intended course of action. When you cast this spell, you can designate a password or other trigger that allows a creature to pass through the threshold unimpeded, such as walking through the threshold backward or whistling a specific tune while stepping through the threshold. You can create a permanently warded threshold by casting this spell on that threshold every day for a year and a day.
  <em>Dome Of Spectral Blows</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 164) – Spectral fists fly out from you, pummeling or grabbing at creatures within 15 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When a creature fails this saving throw, you can choose to forego the damage and restrain the creature with the spectral fists until the start of your next turn instead. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell’s radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Weirding Wake</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 236) – You create a wave of water that rushes in a 30-foot line that is 10 feet wide from a point you can see within range. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction following the line, and knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone. If you cast this spell on a point of freestanding water that is at least 20 feet deep, the line is 60 feet long instead, and any waterborne vehicle in the line has a 30 percent chance of capsizing if it is Large or smaller and a 15 percent chance of capsizing if it is Huge. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the chance for a waterborne vehicle to capsize increases by 5 percent for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Well Of Frozen Missiles</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 236) – A Small, swirling cloud of ice and snow appears and hovers in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The cloud occupies that space and emits a mild chill in the air around it, but it is otherwise indistinct except for a small flurry of snow. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be capable of interacting with the cloud. While within 5 feet of the cloud, a designated creature can use a bonus action to reach into the cloud, pull out a javelin of magical ice, and throw it at a target within 60 feet. The creature throwing the javelin is proficient with the javelin and makes an attack roll using its Strength or Dexterity modifier (the creature’s choice). On a hit, the javelin deals 2d6 cold damage, and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. The cloud lasts for the duration or until six icy javelins have been pulled from it. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt by the javelin on a hit increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Wave Of Putrefacw</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 236) – You unleash a wave of putrefying necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a putrefying disease until cured or until it finishes a long rest. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t afflicted with a disease. A creature afflicted with this disease can’t regain hit points. This spell induces a magical disease in the target that can’t be cured by most effects that remove or ameliorate diseases. A greater restoration or heal spell cast on the target removes this magical disease. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Weight Spike</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 236) – You envelope your hand in a purple light and increase the pull of gravity on a creature you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing heavy armor or is Large or larger. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of its next turn as its own weight pulls on it. The spell’s damage increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4), and 17th level (8d4).
  <em>Steady</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 226) – You imbue yourself with magical balance and surety of foot. For the duration, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against being knocked prone and on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple. In addition, you spend only 5 feet of movement to stand up from being prone.
  <em>Steal Memories</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 226) – You attempt to steal another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. If the target succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, it knows that you tried to access its memories, and it can’t be affected by this spell again for 24 hours. On a failed save, you steal one of the target’s memories for 24 hours. You must specify the type of memory you are trying to steal, and it must be a single event lasting no more than 1 minute, such as “the assassination of the arch duke” or “the password of the day for entrance to the thieves’ guild hideout.” If the memory doesn’t exist in the mind of the target, the spell fails. If the memory exists, you gain the full memory as if you experienced it yourself, including any sensations the target experienced. Until the spell ends, the target can’t recall the memory. When the spell ends, the memory returns to the target, and you can no longer recall it.
  <em>Stench Of Rot</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 226) – Choose one creature you can see within range that isn’t a Construct or an Undead. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. While cursed, the target reeks of death and rot, and nothing short of magic can mask or remove the smell. The target has disadvantage on all Charisma checks and on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells. A creature with the Keen Smell trait, or a similar trait indicating the creature has a strong sense of smell, can add your spellcasting ability modifier to its Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the target. A remove curse spell or similar magic ends the spell early. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Storm Door</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 226) – Crackling with lightning, you teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of both the space you left and your new space must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your bonus action to call up the lightning and open such a storm door again, targeting a different space with the door each time. If you are outdoors when you cast this spell, a storm develops within 1 minute and follows you, and under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases to 2d12, and you can teleport up to 240 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, a creature of your choice within 5 feet of you can teleport through the storm door with you. Accompanying creatures do not suffer the lightning damage.
  <em>Storm Mote</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 226) – You create a Tiny mote of stormy magic next to a creature you can see within range. The mote is immune to damage and can’t be attacked. The next time a target makes an attack roll against you, it has disadvantage on the attack as the mote by it sparks and thunders, distracting the target. That mote then disappears. You can have only one instance of this spell active at a time. If you cast it again while the previous spell is still active, that spell ends. The spell creates one additional mote when you reach 5th level (two motes), 11th level (three motes), and 17th level (four motes). The motes can all hover by one target or each can hover by a different target, provided all targets are within range. When all motes have disappeared, the spell ends.
  <em>Shifting Sand Form</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – Your body takes on the consistency of sand for the duration. Until the spell ends, each time you take damage, the damage is reduced by 1d6. If you use your reaction when you take damage, the damage is reduced by 2d6 instead.
  <em>Shroom Of Doom</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – An array of wispy luminous mushrooms sprouts from a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or 1d8 mushrooms grow out of its body. While the target has at least one mushroom growing from it, the target is poisoned. The target or a creature within reach of it can use its action to remove a mushroom. Removing a mushroom deals 1d4 poison damage to the target.
  <em>Silhouette</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – You create a shadow play against a screen or wall. The surface can encompass up to 100 square feet. The number of creatures that can see the shadow play equals your Intelligence score. The shadowy figures make no sound but they can dance, run, move, kiss, fight, and so forth. Most of the figures are generic types—a rabbit, a dwarf— but a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier can be recognizable as specific individuals.
  <em>Skip Strike</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – You wrap threads of time around an attacker, pushing the attack moments into the future. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or you magically interrupt the triggering attack, causing it to happen on the target’s next turn instead. On the target’s next turn, it gains an additional action it must use to make the attack you interrupted, though the delayed attack can be directed toward any target within the weapon’s range. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points before its next turn or if it is otherwise prevented from making an attack on its next turn, the delayed attack doesn’t happen and is lost.
  <em>Slime Guard</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – You coat yourself in a thick, magical slime. You have advantage on the next ability check you make to escape a grapple before the start of your next turn.
  <em>Slither</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 222) – You momentarily become a shadow (a humanoid- shaped absence of light, not the Undead creature of that name). You can slide under a door, through a keyhole, or through any other tiny opening. All of your equipment is transformed with you, and you can move up to your full speed during the spell’s duration. While in this form, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in darkness or dim light and you are immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You can dismiss this spell by using an action to do so. If you return to your normal form while in a space too small for you (such as a mouse hole, sewer pipe, or the like), you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest space within 50 feet big enough to hold you. If the distance is greater than 50 feet, you take an extra 1d6 force damage for every additional 10 feet traveled. While in shadow form, you can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you are carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. In addition, you can’t attack or cast spells while in shadow form.
  <em>Part Clouds</em> (6 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 205) – The clouds miraculously part within 1 mile of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. When you cast this spell, nonmagical smoke, clouds, fog, and other obscuring mists, including the clouds in the sky, disperse in the area. Magical smoke, clouds, fog, and other obscuring mists disperse after 1 minute in the area. Until the spell ends, you can’t become lost while you travel, and the area is filled with bright sunlight if it is day or dim light if it is night.
  <em>Phalanx Of Light</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 205) – You conjure a spectral battalion of soldiers wielding spears and shields made of light. The soldiers fill a 20-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range. The cube is filled with bright light, and you and friendly creatures within the cube have half cover. The cube is difficult terrain for hostile creatures. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the cube up to 20 feet. A hostile creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 piercing damage and 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  <em>Phantasm</em> (6 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 205) – You reach out with your consciousness and influence the dreams of another creature. The creature must be on the same plane of existence as you and have a minimum Intelligence score of 7. If the target is not asleep or in meditation (in the case of elves or similar creatures) when the spell is cast, the spell fails. This spell has no effect on Constructs or Undead. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s dream becomes a nightmare, and it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage, the spell ends, and you take 4d10 psychic damage as you are shoved from the dream. At the start of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, taking 4d10 psychic damage on a failed save, or ending the spell on a successful one. Once the target succeeds on its saving throw, it can’t be affected by this spell again until 7 days have passed. The target can’t wake itself, but if it is awakened by an outside force or if it is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC. On a success, if the target is familiar with you, it recognizes you as the attacker. If the target succeeds but is unfamiliar with you, it doesn’t recognize you, though at the GM’s discretion, it may vaguely recognize you at a later date if you cross paths. For the duration of the spell, your body lies in repose in the location you cast the spell. You are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings, though you can feel and are aware if you take damage. If your body is moved, the spell ends. If your target is awakened, the spell ends.
  <em>Phantasmal Phalanx</em> (7 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 205) – You summon six golden, phantasmal soldiers in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Each soldier is considered Celestial, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The soldiers are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the soldiers as a group, which has its own turns. You can communicate telepathically with the soldiers as long as you are on the same plane of existence, and the soldiers obey any commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the soldiers, they defend themselves from hostile creatures or position themselves protectively next to you and your allies, each soldier moving to within 5 feet of at least one of you. While positioned protectively, a soldier can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll against the target it is protecting, provided the target remains within 5 feet of the soldier. The GM has the soldiers’ statistics, using a veteran that has a shield and is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
  <em>Slow-Burn Fireball</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 223) – A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it slowly ignites the air itself with phlogiston. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature then takes the same amount of damage at the start of each of its turns for the next two turns. A creature can prevent this extra damage by using an action to put out the flames on itself. The spell ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
  <em>Smolder</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 223) – You cover yourself in an illusion that makes you appear to be on fire. Small flames lick and flicker along your limbs and features. You have advantage on the next Charisma (Intimidation) check you make against a Beast or Humanoid before the spell ends. Once you have used this spell to give yourself advantage on a Charisma (Intimidation) check against a creature, you can’t use this spell in this way against that creature again until that creature finishes a long rest.
  <em>Solitary Fireball</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 223) – A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it blossoms with a low roar to engulf a single creature in searing flame. That creature takes 6d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Solitary fireball does not ignite other flammable objects.
  <em>Song Of The Forest</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 223) – You attune your senses to the natural world so that you detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet: wind blowing through branches, falling leaves, grazing deer, trickling streams, and more. You can clearly picture the source of each sound in your mind. The spell gives you tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Creatures that make no noise or that are magically silent cannot be detected by this spell’s effect.  Song of the forest functions only in natural environments; it fails if cast underground, in a city, or in a building that isolates the caster from nature (GM’s discretion).  Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell also gives you blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.
  <em>Souleater</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 223) – You instill a hunger for the life force of others into a weapon you touch. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits dim light in a 30-foot radius. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  As a bonus action, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and you heal half that many hit points. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and you do not heal.
  <em>Ominous Winds</em> (2nd-Level Enchantment <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 204) – Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d8 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Oneiromancy</em> (1st-Level Divination <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 204) – Dreams can be gateways to understanding, and you can induce such prophetic and insightful dreams in yourself and others. You touch a willing creature of your choice. The creature immediately falls into an enchanted dream state and remains that way for the full length of a normal long rest for that creature, unless awakened or if the target chooses to end the spell early. During this long rest, the target experiences dreams and visions centering around one event or question of its choice, specified at the casting of the spell. The answer in the dreams may be literal, or it may be wrapped in symbolism, omens, and metaphor and left to the dreamer to interpret. This spell doesn’t disrupt the target’s long rest, and the target can still gain the benefits of a long rest if it finishes the long rest while affected by this spell. If the target’s sleep is interrupted, this spell ends and must be cast again for the target to experience the dreams again. Elves and other creatures with immunity to magical sleep can choose whether or not to be affected by this spell. This spell has no effect on Constructs or Undead.
  <em>Orros Mark Of Fate</em> (3rd-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 204) – You succeed on the triggering saving throw and redirect the effect to a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must make a saving throw with disadvantage against the same effect that triggered this spell, suffering its effects as normal. Regardless whether the target succeeds or fails, you still suffer the effects of a successful saving throw, if any.
  <em>Palliative Censure</em> (2nd-Level Enchantment <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 204) – Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, each time the target deals damage with an attack, the damage is halved, and a creature you can see within 30 feet of the cursed target regains hit points equal to that amount immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt.
  <em>Panacea</em> (Cantrip Abjuration <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 204) – You touch a creature suffering from exhaustion or a poison or disease. Until the start of your next turn, the effects of the exhaustion, poison, or disease are suppressed. This spell doesn’t cure the exhaustion, poison, or disease, but it temporarily halts the effects. For example, panacea wouldn’t prevent a poison from continuing to deal damage each round, but it would temporarily pause a reduction to an ability score caused by that poison. After a creature has benefited from this spell for 1 minute (10 rounds), it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
  <em>Storm Of Angels</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 227) – You summon two Celestials of challenge rating 5 or lower, which appear in a flash of golden lightning in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Each Celestial disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The Celestials are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the Celestials as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you), as long as the commands don’t violate the Celestials’ alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to them, the Celestials defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. If your concentration is broken, the Celestials don’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the Celestials, and they may become hostile to you or aid you on their own terms, depending on your alignment and observable actions while the Celestials were summoned. An uncontrolled Celestial can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
  <em>Storm Queen's Children</em> (7th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 227) – You conjure up to three tornados on the ground at points you can see within range. Each tornado is a 10-foot radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air centered on the point. Each creature that enters a tornado for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in a tornado must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a Large or smaller creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. On a failed save, a Huge or larger creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage but is restrained until the start of its next turn instead of being thrown. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t thrown, restrained, or knocked prone, but it is pushed out of the tornado to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the edge of the tornado. If a thrown creature strikes a solid surface, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the creature is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone. If a thrown creature is thrown into another tornado, it is then thrown up to 60 feet again in a random direction from that tornado. At the start of each of your turns, the tornados move up to 30 feet in random directions and can affect you as easily as any other creature. If multiple tornados would move to the same space, one tornado moves to the space, and the other moves to within 10 feet of the space. The spell ends early if you are incapacitated or die.
  <em>Storm Step</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 227) – You release a clap of thunder as you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 5 feet of your origin and destination spaces must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Strafe</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 227) – You speed across the battlefield, releasing small bursts of magic at those you pass. Move up to twice your speed in a straight line. This movement ends early if you would pass through the space of a creature of your size, stopping your move in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of a space you enter during this movement must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d4 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Whipcrack</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 237) – You create a sound like a cracking whip next to one friendly creature and one hostile creature you can see within range. Spurred by the sudden snap of sound, the friendly target has advantage on the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.  Startled by the sound, the hostile target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d10 thunder damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and can still take reactions.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Wilting Breath</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 237) – You cause the breath of one creature to become distractingly awful. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or it takes 1d6 poison damage and has disadvantage on the next Charisma check it makes to influence another creature before the spell ends.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Windblown</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 237) – A blast of air forms beneath a creature you can see within range, launching the creature into the air. If the target isn’t somehow anchored to the ground, it is thrown up to 60 feet into the air. It can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the launch.  If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered on the way up, the target strikes the object and takes falling damage just as if it had fallen the same distance. If the target reaches the full height of 60 feet without striking anything, it remains buoyant, bobbing in the air, for the duration and can be blown along with the prevailing wind.  When the spell ends, the target falls to the ground, taking falling damage as normal. This spell has no effect against a creature with a flying speed.
  <em>Wings Of Retribution</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 237) – Wings of light momentarily sprout from your back. You fly up to 60 feet and land in an unoccupied space you can see. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.  When you land at your destination, each hostile creature within 10 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 and the radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Doom Of Abeyant Time</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 165) – You distort time in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or disappear and be thrown forward in time. At the end of your next turn, the creature returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, unaware that any time has passed.
  <em>Doom Of Antiquity</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 165) – You impart the doom of extreme age upon up to two creatures you can see within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or believe it has been magically aged to an advanced age for the duration. While doomed, a target suffers various effects. At the end of each of its turns, a doomed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
  <em>Doom Of Blue Crystal</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 165) – You are surrounded by a field of glowing, blue energy lasting 3 rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of you, including yourself, must make a Constitution saving throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue of blue crystal. As with all concentration spells, you can end the field at any time. If you are turned to crystal, the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving throws. Restrained and paralyzed creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, but petrification is permanent. Creatures turned to crystal can see, hear, and smell normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is cast on a crystal creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed. Creatures transformed into blue crystal can be restored with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.
  <em>Doom Of Consuming Fire</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 165) – You are wreathed in cold, purple fire that damages creatures near you. You take cold damage each round for the duration of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of you when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect take cold damage.
  <em>Hidden Agent</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 188) – You link your mind and consciousness with that of a creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. For the duration, you can use an action to see, hear, smell, feel, and experience the world through the target’s senses, gaining the benefits of any special senses the target has, until you end the effect (no action required). During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. While sharing a target’s senses, it knows the languages you know if you choose for it to know them, and once each minute, you can influence one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check it makes. If the target was a willing creature, you can give it advantage on the check. If the target was an unwilling creature, you can give it disadvantage on the check. Until the spell ends, you can communicate telepathically with the target, and you know the direction and approximate distance to the target, provided you are both on the same plane of existence. If the target was a willing creature, you can choose for the target to also know the direction and approximate distance to you. An unwilling target can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each minute. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it doesn’t know you are connected to it, such as if you haven’t spoken to the target telepathically and haven’t influenced its ability checks. On a success, the spell ends on the target. A willing target can end the spell as a bonus action. The spell ends early if you or the target are on a different plane of existence from each other, if the target is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the target is incapacitated.
  <em>Hide In One's Shadow</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 188) – When you touch a willing creature with a piece of charcoal while casting this spell, the target and everything it carries blends into and becomes part of the target’s shadow, which remains discernible, although its body seems to disappear. The shadow is incorporeal, has no weight, and is immune to all but psychic and radiant damage. The target remains aware of its surroundings and can move, but only as a shadow could move—flowing along surfaces as if the creature were moving normally. The creature can step out of the shadow at will, resuming its physical shape in the shadow’s space and ending the spell. This spell cannot be cast in an area devoid of light, where a shadow would not normally appear. Even a faint light source, such as moonlight or starlight, is sufficient. If that light source is removed, or if the shadow is flooded with light in such a way that the physical creature wouldn’t cast a shadow, the spell ends, and the creature reappears in the shadow’s space.
  <em>Aqueous Arena</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 138) – You alter the air in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. Within the cylinder, air becomes viscous and takes on some of the properties of water. Creatures inside the cylinder move and fight as if underwater, and objects that aren’t being worn or carried float or sink to the top or bottom of the cylinder as if underwater. Creatures can move vertically within the cylinder as if swimming in water.  Though the cylinder acts like water, it is still air. Creatures and objects within the cylinder don’t have resistance to fire damage from being fully immersed in water, and creatures that breathe air can breathe normally while inside the cylinder. This spell has no effect if cast on a point underwater, and any part of the cylinder that is underwater has no special effect.  When the spell ends, any creature above the ground that doesn’t have a flying speed falls, taking falling damage as normal.
  <em>Arcane Sparkler</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 138) – You fling a condensed ball of colorful lights and sounds at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage, and the target is distracted by the lights and sounds until the start of your next turn. While distracted, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw whenever it casts a spell that requires concentration. On a failed save, the creature can’t concentrate on that spell, losing concentration on it at the start of your next turn.  The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Arrow Door</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 138) – When you cast this spell, two shimmering portals appear: one green portal in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and one purple portal in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the arrow’s target. Any creature can step through the green portal and appear in the purple portal’s space. The portals are one-way. A creature that steps into the purple portal’s space feels a tingling chill but is otherwise unaffected by this spell. The portals last for the duration or until a creature steps through the green portal.
  <em>Arrow Of Ash</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 138) – You create and launch a missile of hardened ash which travels toward one creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage and 3d6 fire damage. When it reaches the target, the ash arrow bursts into a 30-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the target, regardless if the attack hits the target. The cloud of ash spreads around corners, its area is heavily obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute.  When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Caustic Waste</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 149) – You create either a rectangular pool of acid 50 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, or a circular pool of acid 20 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep, in an open space you can see within range. Each creature in the spell’s area when the spell is cast takes 4d10 acid damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature that enters the area on its turn or ends its turn in the area takes 4d10 acid damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Cecily's Stormshot</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 149) – You channel the primal energy of storms into your free hand or spellcasting focus before releasing an instantaneous blast of lightning at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage. If the target is wearing armor or carrying a weapon made of metal, it instead takes 1d10 lightning damage. This spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d10), 11th level (3d8 or 3d10), and 17th level (4d8 and 4d10).
  <em>Celebration</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 149) – You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts. The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, an unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has previously succeeded on a save against the spell.
  <em>Chains Of Justice</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 149) – Chains erupt from a point on the ground you can see within range. The chains cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. For the duration, the chains turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the chains until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the chains can use its action to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it wriggles free of the chains. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to tighten the chains around one creature restrained by the chains. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and be knocked prone.
  <em>Flight Of Ideas</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 180) – You tap into the realm of the fey and fill the mind of one Humanoid you can see within range with eerie ideas, thoughts, and songs of the fey. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bewildered for the duration. The bewildered target must spend each of its turns moving up to half its speed in a random direction and chattering eccentrically, expressing the ideas infiltrating its mind. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
  <em>Flittering Eyes</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 180) – You force the eyes of a creature you can see within range to fly out of its head. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for the duration, as its eyes sprout wings and flitter out from its head. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, each eye flies 30 feet in a random direction without provoking opportunity attacks. Each eye has an Armor Class equal to your spell save DC, or a creature within 5 feet of an eye can catch it with a successful Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If an eye is hit or caught, it disappears in a poof of smoke. If at least half the target’s eyes are hit or caught, the spell ends on the target, ending the blinded condition and returning the target’s eyes to it.
  <em>Florafetter</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 180) – A plant bursts from the ground at the feet of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or the target is restrained as the plant magically wraps around its legs or body. A creature restrained by the plant can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself, and the plant wilts away.
  <em>Flowering</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 180) – You cause fragrant flowers to grow from a nonmagical, inanimate object. If the object is held by an unwilling creature, that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to negate the effect. If sustained for the full duration, the flowers give forth a pleasing scent and may attract bees, hummingbirds, or other pollinators. If the object can’t normally sustain living flowers, the flowers wilt away after 24 hours.
  <em>Forceful Repurposing</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 180) – You attempt to hijack a spell being cast and redirect it to serve your purpose. Make an ability check using your spellcasting ability against a DC of 13 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you choose the target or targets for the spell. Your targets must be valid targets for the spell based on the caster’s ability and the range of the spell, but using your distinctions for friendly and hostile creatures.
  <em>Doom Of The Black River</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 169) – You speak a word of unmaking that devours all wood and leather in the area, destroying leather armor, shield straps, spear shafts, arrows, bows, staves, clubs, and so forth, including your own items. Objects made of other materials, such as linen, wool, glass, and metals, are unaffected. Items that are worn or held gain a collective Dexterity saving throw by the wearer. On a successful save, none of that wearer’s items are affected. Magical items are never affected by this spell.
  <em>Doom Of The Cracked Shield</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 169) – Doom of the cracked shield is cast on a melee weapon. The next time that weapon is used, it destroys the target’s nonmagical shield or damages nonmagical armor, in addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the foe doesn’t use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a −2 penalty to AC. If the target doesn’t use armor or a shield, the spell is expended with no effect.
  <em>Doom Of The Earthen Maw</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 169) – The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate within range turns into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the mud until the spell ends. A restrained creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. A creature that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn’t become restrained. Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified ground. The creature can escape only if someone else digs it out or it has a burrowing speed.
  <em>Doom Of The Pit</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 169) – You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the original surface. Each creature in the pit must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned for 2 rounds after the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the depth of the pit by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Miniature Hurricane</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 200) – You conjure a miniature hurricane on a point you can see within range. The hurricane forms in a 40-foot-tall cylinder with a 20-foot-radius centered on that point. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is buffeted by rain, ice pellets, and roaring wind and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and its speed is halved until it leaves the hurricane. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. Until the spell ends, the hurricane moves up to 20 feet in a random direction at the start of each of your turns. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
  <em>Misstep</em> (Enchantment Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 200) – You gesture to a creature within range that you can see. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it uses its reaction to move 5 feet in a direction you dictate. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The spell automatically fails if you direct the target into a dangerous area such as a pit trap, a bonfire, or off the edge of a cliff, or if the target has already used its reaction.
  <em>Monsoon</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 200) – You create a dark rain cloud in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 40-foot radius, centered on the point you can see 100 feet in the sky directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the rain cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud). The cloud remains centered on you in the sky above you, and moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. Until the spell ends, heavy rain and hailstones fall in the area within 40 feet of you, pummeling creatures and objects and loosening the ground. Nonmagical fires in the area are extinguished, the area is lightly obscured, and the ground in the area is difficult terrain. Any creature other than you that starts its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Moon Trap</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 200) – While casting this spell under the light of the moon, you inscribe a glyph that covers a 10-foot-square area on a flat, stationary surface such as a floor or a wall. Once the spell is complete, the glyph is invisible in moonlight but glows with a faint white light in darkness. Any creature that touches the glyph, except those you designate during the casting of the spell, must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be drawn into an inescapable maze until the sun rises. The glyph lasts until the next sunrise, at which time it flares with bright light, and any creatures trapped inside return to the spaces they last occupied, unharmed. If a space has become occupied or dangerous, the creature appears in the nearest safe unoccupied space.
  <em>Moonlight Charm</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 200) – You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid remains charmed until the spell’s duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it, or until a full moon rises in the sky. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
  <em>Poisonous Flesh</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 208) – You make your flesh and blood poisonous, deterring creatures that might want to devour you. For the duration, any creature that hits you with a Bite attack must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. Creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or lower will not willingly bite you again, seeking other prey instead. If such a creature is unable to disengage from combat with you, it will use other attack actions to deal damage, if possible, but will continue to use its Bite attack if it has no other option.  If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after you take whatever damage is dealt by the creature’s digestion, the creature takes 4d8 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. A successful Constitution saving throw negates the poisoned condition. On its next turn, the creature uses an action to spit you out.
  <em>Polychromatic Bubble</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 208) – You create a shimmering, multicolored bubble around a Large or smaller creature or object within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be trapped within the bubble. A creature that starts its turn inside the bubble can’t see or hear anything outside the bubble and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you and the bubble until the start of its next turn. At the start of each of your turns, the bubble rises 10 feet into the air along with its contents, up to a maximum of 30 feet.  The bubble has an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier. A creature outside the bubble that hits the bubble with an attack must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you and the bubble until the start of its next turn.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can create one additional bubble around one additional target for each slot level above 4th. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Power Word Deplete</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 208) – You utter a word of power at one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it loses a single use of a trait or feature of your choice with limited uses each day, such as spellcasting, Channel Divinity, or Legendary Resistance. If the target has spell slots, and you chose spellcasting, the target loses a spell slot of its highest available level.
  <em>Power Word Fling</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 208) – You mutter a word of power that causes a creature you can see within range to be flung vertically or horizontally. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be thrown up to 15 feet vertically or horizontally. If the target impacts a surface, such as a ceiling or wall, it stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target was thrown vertically, it plummets to the ground, taking falling damage as normal, unless it has a flying speed or other method of preventing a fall. If the target impacts a creature, the target stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and the creature the target hits must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. After the target is thrown horizontally or it falls from being thrown vertically, regardless of whether it impacted a surface, it is knocked prone.  As a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can attempt to fling the same creature again. The target must succeed on another Strength saving throw or be thrown.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the distance you can fling the target increases by 5 feet, and the damage from impacting a surface or creature increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Dead Man Walking</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 161) – You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided it died from a disease or poison and has been dead no longer than 10 days. The creature’s soul must be willing (without knowledge of what spell is resurrecting it) and able to rejoin its body. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point and can’t be healed further. All diseases or poisons that afflicted the creature at the time of its death remain, but it suffers no further damage or penalties from them. The creature can’t be cured of these diseases and poisons, and it is immune to any future diseases or poisons that would afflict it. If the creature is infected with a contagious or transmissible disease or poison, it can continue infecting others. When the spell ends, the creature dies again and can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.
  <em>Death Toll</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 161) – You conjure a shadowy bell in front of you that rings with an ominous, ethereal tone for the duration. When you cast this spell, each creature within 30 feet of you that isn’t an Undead or Construct must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. While frightened by this spell, a creature views you as a specter of death and impending pestilence, and it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, it can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. Until this spell ends, each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you has disadvantage on death saving throws and on Constitution saving throws against disease and necrotic damage.
  <em>Death's Retribution</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 161) – You infuse yourself with devastating energy to be unleashed upon your death. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder. When you die, your body detonates, releasing an explosion of energy in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on your body. Alternatively, you can use your reaction when you are reduced to 0 hit points to trigger this spell, detonating your body and dying immediately. Each hostile creature within that explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creature that inflicted the fatal damage to you has disadvantage on the saving throw, and all 1s on the damage dice are treated as 2s when determining the amount of damage that creature takes. Your body and all nonmagical objects you are wearing and carrying are destroyed when you detonate. If this spell destroys your body, you can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or wish spell. You can use only one death’s retribution spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the previous effect ends and is replaced by the new casting. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
  <em>Grim Shadows</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 184) – Sharp, spear-like shadows fill a 15-foot square of ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these shadows obscure creatures within the area, giving them half cover. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 piercing damage and be blinded until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already blinded takes 1d8 piercing damage. A creature blinded by the grim shadows can use its action to make a Dexterity or Wisdom saving throw (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, its sight returns.
  <em>Grim Siphon</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 184) – You twist the forces of entropy around two creatures, bringing distress to one while staving off the demise of the other. A creature you can see within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take poison damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Another creature you choose that is within 5 feet of the target regains hit points equal to half the amount of poison damage dealt. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Grit In The Eye</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 184) – The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before the spell ends, sand sloughs off your hands and blows into your target’s eyes. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. If you hit the target with an unarmed strike, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the target is no longer blinded. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Guest Of Honor</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 184) – You whisper words of encouragement, and a creature that you touch gains confidence along with approval from strangers. For the spell’s duration, the target puts its best foot forward and strangers associate the creature with positive feelings. The target adds 1d4 to all Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence the attitudes of others. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the effect lasts for 24 hours.
  <em>Halo Of Blood And Tears</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 184) – A halo of glowing, bloody tears appears over your head, around your waist, or around one of your arms. Droplets constantly fall from the halo, striking the ground, where they vanish in a misty explosion. Until this spell ends, you can transfer damage you take into healing or spell energy. Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to store half that damage as magical energy. This effect doesn’t reduce the damage you take, and you can’t use this reaction if you already have energy stored from a previous instance of damage you took. The energy remains stored until expended or until this spell ends. You can expend the energy as a bonus action to cause one of the following effects: • Healing Burst. The next spell you cast that restores hit points to a creature restores an additional amount equal to the stored energy. • Spell Rejuvenation. You regain one expended spell slot of a level determined by the amount of stored energy. You regain an expended 1st-level spell slot if the stored energy is at least 10 damage, a 2nd-level spell slot if the stored energy is at least 20 damage, and so on. You can’t regain multiple spell slots at once with this effect.
  <em>Doom Of Dancing Blades</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 166) – You create 1d4 illusory copies of your weapon that float in the air 5 feet from you. These images move with you, spinning, shifting, and mimicking your attacks. When you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll exceeded your Armor Class by 3 or less, one illusory weapon parries the attack; you take no damage and the illusory weapon is destroyed. When you are hit by a melee attack that an illusory weapon can’t parry (the attack roll exceeds your AC by 4 or more), you take only half as much damage from the attack, and an illusory weapon is destroyed. Spells and effects that affect an area or don’t require an attack roll affect you normally and don’t destroy any illusory weapons. If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory weapons also strike the target and deal 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each. The spell ends when its duration expires or when all your illusory weapons are destroyed or expended. An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to be affected. The spell has no effect if you are invisible or in total darkness or if the attacker is blinded.
  <em>Doom Of Destiny</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 166) – Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target rolls with disadvantage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Doom Of Disenchantment</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 166) – When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you. The spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon’s damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.
  <em>Doom Of False Friends</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 166) – You sever the bonds of friendship and affection between your targets. Target two creatures of your choice within range that can hear and see you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target must use its movement and action to move toward and attack the other target of the spell. If an unaffected target of the spell moves out of range, the other target must make every effort to find and attack it. At the end of each turn that one of the targets cannot see the other target, it can make a new saving throw, overcoming the compulsion on a successful save. Once all the spell’s targets make successful saving throws, you become stunned until the end of your next turn. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 9th level slot, you can target two additional creatures. Each of the targets can decide on its turn which of the other targets it attacks or otherwise works against for the moment.
  <em>Nothing To See Here</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 203) – 1st-Level Enchantment Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: S Duration: 1 hour Creatures relying on eyesight and with a Wisdom score of 11 or less ignore the target as if it were not there—unless directly attacked or addressed by the target. Creatures relying on eyesight and with a Wisdom score of 12 or higher can make a Wisdom saving throw to pierce the illusion and see the target of the spell. Blindsight and tremorsense work normally. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can either target one additional creature or increase the duration of the spell by 1 hour for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Obfuscate Object</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 203) – Illusion Cantrip Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Touch Components: S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute While you are in dim light or darkness, you touch an object and cause it to become unobtrusively obscured from the sight of other creatures. For the duration, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide the object. The object can’t be larger than a shortsword, and it must remain in your pocket, held in your hand, or otherwise on your person or the spell ends. You can affect two objects when you reach 5th level, three objects at 11th level, and four objects at 17th level.
  <em>Obviating Shadow</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 203) – 3rd-Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a piece of coal carved into a humanoid shape) Duration: 1 hour You give your shadow a semblance of life, allowing it to move differently from how nearby light might direct your shadow to move. Until the spell ends, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to prevent the damage to yourself, moving it into the shadow. When the shadow has absorbed 30 damage, it ruptures. You and each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell then ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, your shadow can absorb 10 more damage for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
  <em>Oculus Blossoms</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 203) – 7th-Level Divination Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a carved seed) Duration: 24 hours A Tiny, magical flower grows in a space you can see within range. The space must be capable of supporting a flower, such as a patch of open ground, a pot of dirt, or similar. The blossom is always of a type natural to the region and is indistinguishable from a normal flower. When you cast this spell, you can create a number of these flowers equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Each flower must be at least 5 feet away from another such flower. This spell ends if you cast it again before the duration ends. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to see and hear through one of the flowers as if you were in its space, provided you are on the same plane of existence as the flower. While perceiving through a flower, you can use a bonus action to switch your senses to another of the flowers or to end the effect. A creature that can see invisible things (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible eye in place of the flower’s blossom. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 7 days. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, the duration is 30 days.
  <em>Ominous Shadow</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 203) – 6th-Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (60-foot cone) Components: V, S, M (a horn from a creature native to the Plane of Shadow) Duration: Instantaneous When you cast this spell, you extend your shadow out in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d10 necrotic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws from this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Spectral Perfume</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 224) – You call on your connection with spirits and the spiritual to exude a spectral scent similar to that exuded by ghostly Undead. Until the spell ends, each Undead within 30 feet of you prefers other targets to you, unless you attacked that Undead in the last minute. In addition, if you have taken no aggressive action against an Undead within the last minute, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence Undead within 30 feet of you.
  <em>Spellhunt Step</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 224) – As the spell strikes you, you teleport yourself to the spellcaster, provided the spellcaster is within range and the triggering spell didn’t leave you incapacitated. If you can see the spellcaster, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the spellcaster. If you can’t see the spellcaster, the spellcaster must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or you appear in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the spellcaster. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range of the spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Spider Song</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 224) – You sing a piping tune and conjure shadows into enormous, ever-growing webs. The area within a 20-foot cube within range is filled with shadows, and the area is lightly obscured and provides half cover to any creature within. You may create a new cube of shadows in range every other round so long as you retain concentration, in which case the previous cube disappears 1 round later. Cubes can overlap but there is no cumulative effect from it. Each creature that enters the area or starts its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated for as long as it remains in the shadows or until it breaks free. A creature incapacitated by the shadows can make a Strength check each round against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer incapacitated. The shadows can be removed from a single 20-foot cube with a daylight spell.
  <em>Spirit Balm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 224) – You call on a divine spirit or a spirit of nature to heal your wounds and calm your mind. You and one willing creature you can see within range regain a number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you can choose to end either the charmed or frightened condition on each of you. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Spoil Food And Water</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 224) – You spoil 45 pounds of food, grain, or seeds and 30 gallons of water, ale, or other potable drinks on the ground or in containers within range, normally enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food becomes moldy, rotten, vermin-infested, or liquified. The water is filthy and foul-smelling, and any creature consuming either the food or the beverage is ill for the next 24 hours, moving at half speed and with disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws. At Higher Levels. If cast at 4th level, you spoil up to 150 pounds of food and 100 gallons of beverage. If cast at 5th level, you spoil up to 500 pounds of food and 300 gallons of beverage.

The visible signs of a disease of your choice manifest on the body. These signs are temporary and not contagious, but they appear genuine under the scrutiny of anyone not practiced in diagnosing diseases.
  <em>Plague Walk</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 207) – You conjure a trail of sickly, yellowish-green miasma that follows in your footsteps and lingers on your trail. This miasma is visible as a mist hovering in each space you leave. The mist remains in each of those spaces, forming a trail behind you, for 10 minutes before fading. The mist forms only along the ground and doesn’t form in spaces you left by flying, swimming, or similarly not in contact with the ground. A creature that enters the miasma for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a poisoned creature can make another Constitution saving throw, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success. Nonmagical plants that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die in the miasma in your wake. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the miasma lasts for an additional 10 minutes for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Plaguebearer</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 207) – The creature you touch when casting this spell becomes immune to disease for the duration. The creature can still contract and carry diseases; it simply does not suffer any effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the creature must make the saving throw required. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes a carrier of the disease and might expose others to it per the rules for the particular affliction. The creature under the effect of the spell is aware when it becomes infected. If the creature recovers from or is cured of all diseases it suffers while this spell is in effect, it continues to benefit from the spell until the spell ends. When the duration expires, the target becomes susceptible to the effect of any disease it is still carrying, as if it had just now contracted it. At Higher Levels.

  <em>Pocketful Of Posies</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 207) – You crush a handful of flower petals and sing a morbid rhyme. For the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against disease, and a creature that makes a melee attack against you that could inflict a disease, such as a death dog’s Bite attack, must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell, then this spell ends.
  <em>Poisoned Portal</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 207) – You corrupt one opening, door, portal, or other threshold you can see within range with invisible, poisonous fumes. When you cast this spell, choose one threshold up to 10 feet wide and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature that passes through the opening must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, a poisoned creature can make another Constitution saving throw, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Defile Healing</em> (7th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 162) – You attempt to reverse the energy of a healing spell so that it deals damage instead of healing. If the healing spell is being cast with a spell slot of 5th level or lower, the slot is expended but the spell restores no hit points. In addition, each creature that was targeted by the healing spell takes necrotic damage equal to the healing it would have received, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
  <em>Deflection</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 162) – You wave your hand toward an attacker, briefly placing a magical barrier between you. The damage you take from the triggering attack is reduced by 1d6, as you deflect some of it. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can turn the deflected damage back onto your attacker. Make a melee spell attack against the attacker. On a hit, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage you deflected. The damage you can deflect increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Dehydration</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 162) – You rapidly heat the air around a creature you can see within range, evaporating the water within its body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 fire damage and suffers one level of exhaustion.

Celestials, constructs, elementals, fiends, and creatures that don’t need to drink to survive are immune to this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Densini's Radiance</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 162) – You call down an explosion of radiant fire from the heavens on a point you can see in range. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage and is marked with holy radiance until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t marked. The next attack roll against a marked creature before the end of your next turn has advantage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Desolation</em> (8th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 162) – You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by desolation. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, rejoining the march of nature. A living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.
  <em>Shadow Tendrils</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 220) – Writhing ribbons of quasi-real darkness extend from your hand. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack with the tendrils against any creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 cold damage and must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.  A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadow tendrils takes the cold damage again. It can take an action to make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC to free itself. On your turn, as a bonus action, you can drag a creature restrained by the shadow tendrils up to 15 feet closer to you.  The tendrils have AC 13 and 12 hit points. They are immune to bludgeoning damage and to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. They are vulnerable to radiant damage. If the tendrils are destroyed by damage but the spell is still in effect, you can re-form them on your turn as a bonus action.
  <em>Shadow Trove</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 220) – You paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on a hard surface to create a portal into the void of space. The portal “peels off ” the surface you painted it on and follows you when you move, always floating in the air within 5 feet of you. An icy chill flows out from the portal. You can place up to 750 pounds of nonliving matter in the portal, where it stays suspended in the frigid void until you withdraw it. Items that are still inside the shadow trove when the duration ends spill out onto the ground. You can designate a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier who have access to the shadow trove; only you and those creatures can move objects into or out of the portal.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 2 hours for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Shadows Brought To Light</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 220) – If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target’s voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target’s native language.  If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature’s saving throw had succeeded.  If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a –2 penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was present when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until the target finishes a long rest.  Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the –2 penalty.
  <em>Strip Wood</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 228) – You temporarily clothe a creature in the bark from nearby plants. Choose a creature you can see within range that is within 10 feet of a tree, shrub, or other nonmagical plant with bark. The plant can’t be a Plant creature. The target’s AC increases by 2 until the start of your next turn, as you temporarily move the bark from the plant to the target.
  <em>Stygian Eye</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 228) – You create a spherical eyeball from magical shadow that floats just behind and above your head. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can cause the eye to emit one of the following effects: • Darkbolt.

On a hit, the target takes 2d6 cold damage and 2d6 necrotic damage. • Envenomed Pulse. The eye releases a sickening, strobing pulse at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. • Shadow Sentry. The eye emits magically disruptive pulses. The eye interrupts the next spell cast within 60 feet of you by a hostile creature before the start of your next turn. The spell must include you as a target or in its area and must be of 6th level or lower, otherwise the eye doesn’t interrupt the spell. An interrupted spell fails and has no effect. If the eye interrupts a spell, the eye disappears, and this spell ends. • Umbrage Beam. The eye sends a beam of disorienting shadow at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 and the poison damage increases by 1d8 for each slot above 6th. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the eye’s Shadow Sentry effect can interrupt a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
  <em>Surprising Bound</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 228) – Your legs become springy for the duration. Until the spell ends, your long jump is equal to your walking speed, and your high jump is equal to half your walking speed, with or without a running start. If you jump out of a creature’s reach, the movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, your long jump distance increases by 10 feet, and your high jump increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Swing And A Missile</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 228) – You take advantage of the momentary distraction an ally’s attack provides, firing a miniature arcane missile at your ally’s target just as the ally’s attack misses. Make a ranged spell attack against your ally’s target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 force damage. This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
  <em>Rise</em> ( <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 228) – Your faith is focused into a short utterance or warcry, which extends out from you in a 15-foot radius and causes one of the following effects of your choice: Rise.

  <em>Withering Smite</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 238) – Your weapon radiates terrible energy that empowers the next strike you make with it. The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.If the target of that attack was a creature, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, its flesh rotting around the wound. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The rotting effect also ends if the affected creature receives magical healing.
  <em>Woodland Walk</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 238) – You touch a willing creature. Difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn’t cost the target extra movement. In addition, the target can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or similar hazards.
  <em>Word Of Unmaking</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 238) – This spell destroys one Tiny, nonmagical object you touch, such as a key, a dagger, or a tankard. The object must weigh less than 2 pounds and be no larger than 1 foot in any dimension. If the object you touch is a container, the contents within it spill out as the container dissolves. This spell has no effect on objects made at least partially of mithral or adamantine, and it has no effect on an object held, worn, or carried by another creature.
  <em>Word Of Warning</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 238) – You use a creature’s name to bind its will, reducing its effectiveness against you. Choose a creature you can see within range. You must speak at least one name to which the target will answer or with which the target identifies, though you need not know its language. The name can’t be vague, like “ogre,” but it doesn’t have to be the creature’s actual name. For example, the local legend name of “Ol’ Gold Eye” for an ogre with a golden false eye can suffice, if the target often identifies itself as such, if the target is accustomed to answering to the name, or if the name is regularly used by others to define the target.The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on saving throws against its spells and abilities until the spell ends.
  <em>Wound Surge</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 238) – You speak a profane word, causing the wounds on nearby creatures to worsen. Choose up to two creatures you can see within range that don’t have all their hit points. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you say a target’s name as part of casting this spell, and the target fails the saving throw, that target is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
  <em>Hellfire Blitz</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 187) – Upon casting hellfire blitz, you assume a flaming spectral form until the end of your turn. You immediately move up to 40 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, but you must end your turn in an unoccupied space. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature whose space you pass through takes 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. You leave a 5-foot-wide line of hellfire burning behind you in your path. This hellfire continues burning for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. A creature that ends its turn in hellfire or passes through the line on its turn takes 1d6 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
  <em>Helper's Hands</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 187) – Small, stone hands rise up from the ground beneath a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the hands. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the hands up to 20 feet along the ground. If the hands are grappling a creature, the grappled creature is dragged along and takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If the hands aren’t grappling a creature and stop within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.

A creature of your choice within range gains advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws for the duration. At the same time, creatures that attack your target, or that make a saving throw against a spell or effect originating from your target, have advantage on their roll. If your target is unwilling, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to avoid the effects.
  <em>Hibernation</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 187) – You hum a soothing melody and rub a bit of bear fur, inducing a soporific healing state in a creature you touch. The target regains 1d6 hit points and sleeps for 10 minutes per each hit point regained. If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall asleep for the duration.

If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target’s next eldest offspring. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.

That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light until the end of your next turn. While outlined in light, the creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against it is made with advantage if the attacker can see the creature, and the creature can’t benefit from being invisible.
  <em>Amplify Sound</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 137) – You turn your attention to a point you can see within range, creating an invisible sensor in that location. For the duration of the spell, you hear sounds from that point as if you were in its space. If the space where the point is located is subjected to thunder damage, you take the thunder damage as if you were in the space, but you don’t suffer other effects associated with that thunder damage. For example, if a creature casts the thunderwave spell, and the point you chose is within the spell’s area, you take thunder damage as if you failed the saving throw, but you aren’t pushed. A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a thin, luminous string winding from the sensor to you.
  <em>Anneal</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 137) – You touch a nonmagical melee weapon, temporarily making it stronger, sharper, and more destructive.

The shape of the apparition changes in the minds of creatures who behold it, appearing as a comforting something or someone that beckons to the creature. When you cast this spell, choose up to three creatures within range that can see the apparition. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the apparition until this spell ends. While charmed, a target must take the Dash action and move toward the apparition by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target ends its turn within 5 feet of the apparition, the target takes 2d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends for that target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Brilliant Harrier</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 146) – You create a glowing bird of flame on a point you can see within range. The harrier bird hovers in place, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and it lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. Until this spell ends, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of the harrier makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that target disadvantage on that roll, as the glowing harrier swoops down to distract the target. If the roll fails, the target takes 1d4 fire damage. The harrier has an AC equal to your spell save DC. Each time it is hit, roll a d20. On a result of 9 or less, it vanishes.

Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the brimstone must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. The brimstone can be destroyed; it has AC 8 and 12 hp. The brimstone explodes if it takes fire damage; the explosion ends the spell and deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 15 feet, or half as much damage to a creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Broken Charge</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 146) – When an enemy that you can see moves to within 5 feet of you, you utter a perplexing word that alters the foe’s course. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage and use the remainder of its speed to move in a direction of your choosing without provoking opportunity attacks. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Bromn's Earthen Escape</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 146) – You throw your hand above your head, clenching it into a fist as you do, and the friendly creature, which can include yourself, that was attacked is magically pulled into and through the ground by an earthen hand. The hand pops up in an unoccupied space on the ground within 30 feet of where the target was previously located and deposits the target in that space before disappearing. The triggering attack against the target fails. The area within 10 feet of the origin and destination spaces becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. You and the target must be on the same ground, rock, soil, sand, or similarly earthen surface, or the spell fails.
  <em>Bryn's Bullying Brogue</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 146) – You toss a nonmagical shoe toward a creature you can see within range. The shoe grows to tremendous size before falling onto the target. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone or restrained, and the spell ends. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to deal 2d10 bludgeoning damage to the target as the shoe grinds the target into the ground. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw, breaking free on a success. When the target breaks free or when the spell ends, the shoe shrinks to its normal size, becoming a nonmagical shoe once again.
  <em>Grasp Of The Briar</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 183) – Tainted, twisted, semi-spectral vines erupt from the ground and spread out from you to a distance of 10 feet for the duration, remaining centered on you and moving with you. For the duration, the vines turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain for hostile creatures. A hostile creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the vines until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the vines takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

  <em>Grave Sense</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 183) – You touch a willing undead creature or one that’s under your control. For the duration of the spell, you can use an action to see what the undead creature sees (including through darkvision, blindsight, tremorsense, or truesight), and to hear what it hears, until the start of your next turn. You use your own ability scores and skill proficiencies to spot things and to interpret the sensations you’re receiving.
  <em>Greater Maze</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 183) – This spell functions as maze, but the target must make a Dexterity saving throw each time it starts its turn in the maze. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Escaping this maze is especially difficult. To do so, the target must use an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence check. It escapes when it makes its second successful check.
  <em>Grim Harvest</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 183) – You reap the life force of a dying creature and use it to empower the next spell you cast. Your target must be at 0 hit points and dying or must have died within the last round. If the target is dying, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die. The next time you cast a spell, you gain 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier in temporary hit points and can choose one of the following effects to inflict on the spell’s target in addition to the usual effects of the spell you are casting. If the spell has more than one target, pick only one target to suffer the effect. If you don’t cast another spell within 1 minute of casting this one, the effect is lost. Clumsiness.

  <em>Glimpse The End</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 182) – You examine the life force in a creature you touch and sense when it will expire. You and the creature share a vision of the most likely way in which the creature will die. You both sense approximately how far into the future the event occurs. The vision is not a prophecy or a definite fate; life can take unexpected twists and turns. It is, however, the most likely outcome at the current time unless the creature alters the course of its life. The vision can seem to last as little as a few moments or as long as 30 minutes to you and the spell’s target, but in the objective world, the knowledge is received instantaneously.
  <em>Gloaming</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 182) – Magical gloom spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 50-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The fading twilight spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can illuminate it. Ranged attacks made through the gloaming have disadvantage. If the point you choose is an object being worn or carried, the effect emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the gloaming with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of magical light created by a spell of 1st level or lower, that effect is dispelled.
  <em>Gnaw</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 182) – You touch a piece of wood, rope, cloth, thatch, or other organic material, and a hole appears through it up to 3 inches long and 1 inch in diameter, circumscribed with tooth marks as if chewed by rodents or other vermin.

It has no effect on metal or stone objects.
  <em>Goob's Inconvenient Gathering</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 182) – One creature you can see within range becomes magically charged. Make a ranged spell attack.

At the start of each of its turns, small, nonmagical objects that aren’t being worn or carried within 10 feet of the target roll, float, or otherwise move up to 10 feet and magically cling to the target. Each object must weigh no more than 10 pounds. The target, or a creature within reach of the target, can use an action to remove the objects from the target until the start of the target’s next turn. While objects are stuck to it, the target’s speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls that use Dexterity. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
  <em>Bubble Barrier</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 147) – A translucent but solid sphere of water encloses a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Creatures can’t pass through the bubble, but physical objects, energy, or other spell effects can. The bubble has an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to twice your spell save DC. The spell ends for the enclosed creature if the bubble is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature inside the bubble has three-quarters cover from attacks outside the bubble, and creatures outside the bubble have half cover from attacks from the enclosed creature. When the enclosed creature would take damage from an attacker or effect outside the bubble, the creature can choose to take only half the damage and reduce the bubble’s hit points by an amount equal to the other half of the damage. The bubble is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature inside of it. When the enclosed creature moves, the bubble moves with it. If the bubble was created in an area with air, the bubble contains enough air for a breathing creature contained within it to breathe for the duration of the spell. If the bubble was created in an area of water, the bubble contains enough water for a water-breathing creature to breathe for the duration of the spell.
  <em>Buffeting Wings</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 147) – You touch a willing creature. The target grows a pair of heavy, stony wings.

The target must be standing on the surface of an area of earth or stone that is large enough to contain the target’s entire body and that is at least 6 feet deep, or the spell fails. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target is restrained by earth or stone until the end of its next turn. On a failed save, the target is dragged up to 6 feet under the surface and is incapacitated and restrained until the spell ends. The displaced earth or stone becomes a mound on the surface in the space the target previously occupied. When the spell ends, the target is harmlessly pushed to the surface in the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the target remains restrained underground until it or another creature digs it out.
  <em>Aegis Of Honor</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg Unknown) – You reach out toward the friendly target, placing a brief barrier between the target and the target’s attacker. The damage the target takes is reduced by 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If this effect reduces the damage to 0, you can turn the damage back on the attacker.

A gout of fire emerges from your chest and streaks toward one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Undead and creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait have disadvantage on the saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
  <em>Heavy Metal</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 186) – Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal statue, that you can see within range.

A weapon affected by this spell gains the Heavy property and loses the Finesse property, if it has that property. A creature wielding a weapon affected by this spell has disadvantage on attack rolls with the weapon, and the weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit.

  <em>Zone Of Radiance</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 239) – Your radiant magic blankets you and your allies, preventing corruption and rot. Each friendly creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has resistance to necrotic damage and is immune to disease until the end of your next turn.

  <em>Templar's Mercy</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 229) – Your quick prayer prevents catastrophe. The target regains 1 hit point. The triggering effect is a death saving throw, the target regains the hit point immediately, even if the saving throw is the target’s third failed death saving throw.
  <em>Temporal Reflection</em> (8th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 229) – You wreathe strands of time around your body, copying the moment the attack or spell affects you. You are affected by the attack or spell as normal. At the start of your next turn, a copy of the attack or spell reflects back at the attacker or spellcaster, using the attack roll, spell DCs, and similar statistics of the original attack or spell. If the creature that made the triggering attack or cast the triggering spell is no longer a valid target, such as if it died or if it is out of range, the copied attack or spell fails.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. A lesser restoration spell cast on the target also ends the spell.
  <em>Shadowy Retribution</em> (4th-Level Necromancy (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 221) – You fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking 1d4 piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark. Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked; a shadow materializes within 5 feet of you. The shadow attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points, ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at which point the shadow dissipates into nothing.
  <em>Shamal's Grasp</em> (2nd-Level Conjuration <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 221) – You create a blast of wind and debris that buffets a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is buffeted by wind for the duration.

Until the start of your next turn, you become invisible, and you are immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. At the start of your next turn, any creature that saw you in the past minute but that can’t see you now forgets it saw you for the next 24 hours, its mind filling gaps in details or dismissing any memory of you as a dream. This effect ends early if the creature sees you within that time frame.
  <em>Detect Secrets</em> (4th-Level Divination (Ritual) <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 163) – For the duration, you sense the presence of secret doors, concealed traps, and areas hidden by magical or mundane covers within 30 feet of you. If you sense a secret in this way, you see a faint aura around the secret, such as an aura outlining a secret door, a glow highlighting a trapped flagstone, or a shimmering across the illusory wall that hides a passage beyond it. A secret door or hidden area, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything purposefully hidden or concealed in some way by its creator. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, a mechanical pit trap, a leaf-covered pit, a door behind a hanging tapestry, or a door flush with a stone wall that is opened by a pressing a specific stone. The spell would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, an evil tome “hidden” in plain sight alongside other books, or a crystalline phylactery “hidden” in a display case with other crystals. This spell merely reveals a secret’s presence and its location. You don’t learn the methods of opening, disarming, or otherwise bypassing or revealing the secret, but you do learn the general nature of the secret and, if it is a trap, the danger it poses. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
  <em>Detect Shapechanger</em> (1st-Level Divination <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 163) – For the duration, you sense the presence of shapechangers within 30 feet of you and can pinpoint their locations in that area. You also learn whether the creature is in its true form or a different form. This spell detects only creatures whose bodies have been transformed in some way, such as a werewolf ’s Change Shape or the alter self spell. It doesn’t detect creatures disguised by illusions or other similar magic, such as a hag’s Illusory Appearance or the disguise self spell. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
  <em>Detonate Corpses</em> (5th-Level Necromancy <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 163) – You cause up to five corpses of Small or Medium creatures that you can see within range to explode in a hail of bone shards.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

On a failed save, it takes 3d10 force damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and its speed isn’t reduced. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to force this creature to repeat the saving throw, taking damage and reducing its speed as normal. The spell ends early if the target is ever outside the spell’s range. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Plague Doctor's Call</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 206) – You inhale deeply of the herb-and-flower parcel and attune yourself to the ebb and flow of pestilent spirits. For the duration, whenever you are within 1 mile of an active epidemic (a contagious disease currently affecting 10 or more creatures within 1,000 feet of each other), the scent of the herbs and flowers intensifies. This scent becomes stronger when you are pointed in the direction of the nearest victim of the epidemic and for as long as you continue moving in its direction. The scent vanishes and the spell ends when you are within 30 feet of a victim of an epidemic you sensed with this spell.
  <em>Plague Hysteria</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 206) – Your touch curses a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead with the symptoms of a disease of your choice, which can include cackle fever, sewer plague, or any of the diseases caused by the contagion spell or found in the Random Disease table in Chapter 2. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become convinced it is suffering from a disease, including manifesting physical symptoms. However, it suffers no actual damage, conditions, or penalties from this disease. All symptoms are superficial and vanish when the spell ends. This is a curse, not a disease, and as such, spells and effects that cure or detect diseases have no effect. While cursed and manifesting symptoms, the target emits an aura of hysterical fear. A creature that isn't a Construct or Undead and that comes within 60 feet of the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target. While frightened, that creature must take the Dash action and move away from the target by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the cursed target, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the frightened effect ends for it, the creature can't be frightened by this spell again for the next 24 hours.
  <em>Mudslide</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 202) – You create and cause a cascade of mud to flow from a point on the ground you can see within range. The mud flows in a direction of your choice in a 30-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each object in the line that isn’t being worn or carried is buried under 5 feet of mud. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to half the length of the line in a direction following the line, knocked prone, and buried under the mud. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed, knocked prone, or buried. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A buried creature, or a creature within reach of a buried creature, can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, the buried creature is no longer buried.
  <em>Negative Image N</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 202) – You create a shadow tunnel between your location and one other creature you can see within range. You and that creature instantly swap positions. If the target creature is unwilling to exchange places with you, it can resist the effect by making a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.
  <em>Nexus</em> (7th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 202) – You conjure up to four magical doorways in a surface you touch. The surface must be large enough to accommodate the doors, which are large enough for a Large or smaller creature to pass through. When you cast this spell, choose a nonmagical archway, doorway, or other threshold you have moved through at least once within 100 miles of you for each magical doorway you create. Each magical doorway opens onto the location of its associated nonmagical threshold for the duration. The spell ends early if the surface on which the magical doorways appear is destroyed. When you cast this spell, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You and the chosen creatures are the only creatures able to use the magical doorways. The magical doorways are two-way for such creatures, allowing the creatures to pass between the two locations by moving through the doorways, opening the destination doors if necessary. All other creatures see the magical doorways as door-like outlines or silhouettes in a style of your choice on the surface you touched, and they see and can interact with the nonmagical thresholds at the destinations as if the locations weren’t tied to magical doorways.
  <em>Nimble Dance</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 202) – A creature you touch moves with stunning grace. For the duration, the creature can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns. If the creature doesn’t use the bonus action granted by this spell during its turn, it becomes evasive until the start of its next turn. While evasive, if it is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.
  <em>Spray</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 225) – You conjure a powerful torrent of water in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line, and knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone. At Higher Levels.

  <em>Spy</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 225) – You create an inter-dimensional opening the size of a spyglass lens in a space you can see within range.

  <em>Doom Of Fools</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 167) – All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. You must also make this save. On a failed save, targets become bumbling and inept for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose one from the following options: • Choose one ability score. While doomed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score. • While doomed, the target falls prone at the start of each round, and its speed is halved. • While doomed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn, doing nothing.
  <em>Doom Of Laughter</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 167) – All creatures within range (including you) perceive everything as hilariously funny and fall into fits of laughter if this spell affects them. The targets must make a Wisdom saving throw. You must also make this save. On a failed save, targets fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less are not affected. At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, a target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell’s effect ends.
  <em>Doom Of Night</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 167) – You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of pulsing, luminous purple mist centered on a point you choose within range. This area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe. After leaving the mist, the creature takes 5 points of necrotic damage per round until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw or dies.
  <em>Doom Of Poor Fortune</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 167) – You turn luck against a creature of your choice within range. When the target makes an ability check, they must first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails. This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent effect is added to the effect noted above. If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving throw or attack at higher levels), then you take 1 psychic damage. If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage.
  <em>Doom Of Serpent Coils</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 167) – You drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread the effect to other living things around you. If the poison normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically fails. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before spreading the poison to all other living creatures within 10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw against the poison, each creature around you makes a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn’t suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent successful save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.
  <em>Shadow Blindness</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – You make a melee spell attack against a creature you touch that has darkvision as an innate ability; on a hit, the target’s darkvision is negated until the spell ends. This spell has no effect against darkvision that derives from a spell or a magic item. The target retains all its other senses.
  <em>Shadow Gateway</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – By drawing a circle of black chalk up to 15 feet in diameter and chanting for one minute during the casting time, you open a portal directly into the Plane of Shadow. The portal fills the chalk circle and appears as a vortex of inky blackness; nothing can be seen through it. Any object or creature that passes through the portal instantly arrives safely at the destination. The portal remains open for 1 minute or until you stop concentrating on the spell, and it can be used to travel between the Plane of Shadow and the chalk circle, in both directions, as many times as desired during the spell’s duration.
  <em>Shadow Hands</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a 10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes 2d4 necrotic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the frightened condition. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the attack increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Shadow Metamorphosis</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – You touch a creature of Huge size or smaller, or a single object no more than 20 feet in any dimension, and transform it into malleable shadow-stuff. Objects under the effect of the spell are not immaterial, but are easy to shape or compress. One could not walk through a door that is affected by the spell, but the door could be pulled aside like a curtain and bypassed, or pulled up like the bottom edge of a tent flap and crawled under, even if the door was locked. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. A creature under the effect of the spell is amorphous and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In dim light or darkness, the creature has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A creature under the effect of this spell cannot make attacks or cast spells and has vulnerability to radiant damage.
  <em>Shadow Monsters</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – You choose up to two creatures within range. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature perceives its allies as hostile, shadowy monsters, and it must attack its nearest ally. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Shadow Passenger</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 218) – You step into a shadow you can see within range, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the shadow for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the shadow at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses except truesight.  You can perceive the surroundings around the shadow out to a radius of 10 feet, but you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If the shadow moves, you move with it. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged with the shadow. You can use your movement to leave the shadow, exiting into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the shadow and ending the spell. You otherwise can’t move. If the shadow is destroyed, such as from a source of bright light, the spell ends, you are expelled, emerging prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where the shadow was located, and take 6d6 radiant damage. If you willingly exit the shadow, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make before the start of your next turn, and if you hit a creature with that attack, the attack deals an extra 3d8 necrotic damage to the target.
  <em>Trade Corporeality</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 230) – A ghostly creature you can see within range becomes solid and more lifelike. If the target doesn’t have the Incorporeal Movement trait, the spell fails. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become corporeal as you become incorporeal. For the duration, the target loses its Incorporeal Movement trait and any resistances it has to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage as well as any resistances it has to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Until the spell ends, you gain the Incorporeal Movement trait and the resistances the target lost.
  <em>Transmogrification</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 230) – You elevate your body to a higher form. When you cast the spell, choose three of the forms described below and indicate which one’s effects will occur first. While the spell lasts, you can use a bonus action to exchange one of your choices for an unused one, or to make a new choice when the current one ends. The spell ends when its duration expires or when you expend all available uses of the third form you adopt. Wings. You sprout wings from your shoulders and gain a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings can be batlike or feathered. Breath Weapon. You gain a breath weapon of one of these types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can use an action to unleash your breath weapon in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 8d6 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. The breath weapon is considered a magical attack. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use. Limbs. Appendages resembling tentacles, spider legs, pincers, or something else of your choosing sprout from your body. Choose slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage; you can use an action to make two melee weapon attacks with your new limbs, and each attack deals 2d12 damage of the chosen type. You are proficient with these weapons, and they have the reach and finesse properties. Radiating Light. You emit light in a 10-foot radius. The light can come from a halo, from ghostly flames, from your eyes, or any other source you choose. The light deals your choice of necrotic, fire, or radiant damage. A creature that passes through the light on its turn or that ends its turn in the light takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. Regeneration. You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use. Overwhelming Might. When you hit a target with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Frightening Presence. As an action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you. Each of them must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your frightening presence for the next 24 hours. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.
  <em>Abhorrent Apparition</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 240) – You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
  <em>Labyrinth Mastery</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – Upon casting this spell, you immediately gain a sense of your surroundings. If you are in a physical maze or any similar structure with multiple paths and dead ends, this spell guides you to the nearest exit, although not necessarily along the fastest or shortest route. In addition, while the spell is guiding you out of such a structure, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid being surprised and on initiative rolls. You gain a perfect memory of all portions of the structure you move through during the spell's duration. If you revisit such a portion, you recognize that you've been there before and automatically notice any changes to the environment. Also, while under the effect of this spell, you can exit any maze spell (and its lesser and greater varieties) as an action without needing to make an Intelligence check.
  <em>Last Strike</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – You grant yourself a last burst of energy when deeply wounded. Before you fall unconscious, you gain one action. Any roll you make, such as for an ability check or attack roll, has advantage. You automatically fail your first death saving throw.
  <em>Leaden Wings</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – You hinder the wings of a creature you can see within range that has a flying speed. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its flying speed can't be higher than 30 feet for the duration. In addition, if the target flies on its turn, it must end its movement on a solid surface, such as a roof or the ground. If it is flying at the end of its turn, it falls to the ground and takes falling damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  <em>Legion</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – You call down a legion of shadowy soldiers in a 10-foot cube. Their features resemble a mockery of once-living creatures. Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the cube or within 5 feet of it, or enters the cube for the first time on its turn, the conjured shades make an attack using your melee spell attack modifier; on a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage. The space inside the cube is difficult terrain.
  <em>Leiloch's Arduous Shuffle</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – All creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you that have fewer hit points than you when you cast the spell are compelled to dance a swaying, side-to-side shuffle-step. Any creature that can't be charmed is immune to the effects of this spell. An affected creature has its movement halved, cannot use reactions, and can make only one weapon or spell attack on its turn. At the beginning of its turn, a creature in the area can choose to take 1d4 levels of exhaustion to end the effect of this spell on itself. A creature that has gained levels of exhaustion from this spell can remove all of them upon finishing a short rest.
  <em>Leiloch's Interminable Yarn</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 193) – You tell a meandering story that is so full of asides and digressions that the point of it is lost on listeners. Any creature that is deafened or can't be charmed is immune to the effects of this spell. Creatures of your choice in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you are compelled to stop what they are doing and listen to your story. While they are enraptured by your words, they automatically fail Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight and Perception) checks, and their passive scores in those skills are considered to be 0 for the duration. A creature can choose to pull away from your performance but must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. This spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.
  <em>Black Hole</em> (9th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 143) – You create a tiny black hole at a point you can see within range. The black hole is a sphere with a 15-foot radius. All fires and flames within 40 feet of the black hole—magical or otherwise—are instantly extinguished. Each creature within 40 feet of the black hole when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d6 force damage and is pulled to within 5 feet of the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is knocked prone but isn’t pulled toward the black hole. A creature that’s within 5 feet of the black hole at the start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 8d6 force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature that’s within 40 feet of the black hole (but not within 5 feet of it) at the end of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while within 5 feet of the black hole dies immediately.
  <em>Black Ribbons</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 143) – Centered on a point you can see within range, you pull pieces of the Plane of Shadow into your own reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes restrained by the ribbons until the end of its next turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can’t be restrained again by the ribbons, but it’s still affected by the difficult terrain.
  <em>Black Well</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 143) – You summon a seething sphere of dark energy 5 feet in diameter at a point within range. The sphere pulls creatures toward it and devours the life force of those it envelops. Every creature other than you that starts its turn within 90 feet of the black well must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 50 feet toward the well. A creature pulled into the well takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is stunned; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and causes the creature to become incapacitated. A creature that starts its turn inside the well also makes a Constitution saving throw; the creature is stunned on a failed save or incapacitated on a success. An incapacitated creature that leaves the well recovers immediately and can take actions and reactions on that turn. A creature takes damage only upon entering the well—it takes no additional damage for remaining there—but if it leaves the well and is pulled back in again, it takes damage again. A total of nine Medium creatures, three Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be inside the well’s other-dimensional space at one time. When the spell’s duration ends, all creatures inside it tumble out in a heap, landing prone. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt by the well increases by 1d8—and the well pulls creatures an additional 5 feet—for each slot level above 6th.
  <em>Blade Of Blood And Bone</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 143) – When you cast this spell, you cut your body with the material component, your hit point maximum decreases by 3 and the material component temporarily disappears. For the duration, you can use a bonus action to draw a blade made of your own bone, blood, and sinew from your body. The blade is a magical weapon, uses your spell attack bonus when you attack with it, and deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You are considered proficient with the blade. As a bonus action, you can slide the blade back into your body to conceal it. When the duration ends, the incision in your body disappears, your hit point maximum is restored, and the material component reappears. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage dealt by the blade increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd, and your hit point maximum decreases by an additional amount equal to the level of the slot used.
  <em>Chorus Of Thunder</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 152) – You utter, shout, or sing a short verse to damage and deafen your enemies. A cacophonous clap of thunder slams out from you in a 30-foot cone that is audible out to 300 feet. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened.  When you cast this spell, up to four friendly creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you can each use a reaction to join the chorus with a clash of weapon against shield, a ringing shout, or other loud noise. For each creature that joins the chorus, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6, and the cone’s size increases by 5 feet.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the primary damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Chrysalis</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 152) – A protective chrysalis surrounds a creature you can see within range as it is reduced to 0 hit points. While protected in this way, the target is still unconscious from being reduced to 0 hit points, but unlike when a creature is normally unconscious, attacks from attackers within 5 feet aren’t automatically critical hits. In addition, the target has three-quarters cover and isn’t prone while protected. The target must make applicable death saving throws, as normal.  The chrysalis has hit points equal to 5d8 + three times your spellcasting ability modifier. When the protected target would take damage, the chrysalis takes the damage instead. The chrysalis is destroyed when it has 0 hit points.  If the chrysalis remains at the end of your next turn, the target regains hit points equal to the chrysalis’s remaining hit points, then the chrysalis crumbles to dust and is destroyed. As the chrysalis crumbles, spectral wings manifest on the target’s back, and the target gains a flying speed of 30 feet for 1 minute.
  <em>Claw Guard</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 152) – You ward a creature you touch against attacks. A pair of raking beastly claws appears on the target as a tattoo, embroidery, painted symbol, or similar decorative embellishment for the duration. The next time the target is hit with a melee attack by an attacker within 5 feet ofit before this spell ends, the attacker takes 1d8 slashing damage as the claws rise up and slash at the attacker. The claws then disappear and the spell ends.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
  <em>Claws Of Darkness</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 152) – You shape shadows into claws that grow from your fingers and drip inky blackness. The claws have a reach of 10 feet. While the spell lasts, you can make a melee spell attack with them that deals 1d10 cold damage.
  <em>Clearing The Field</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 152) – With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain become clear ground and no longer hamper movement. The original plant life instantly rises from the ground again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures are not affected by clearing the field.  Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, each Plant creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or decrease in size as if it failed the saving throw against the reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell.
  <em>Feast Of Flesh</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 177) – A creature of your choice within range is overcome with a need to consume the flesh of its own kind. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its teeth become needlelike, and it becomes able to pinpoint creatures of the same type as it within 150 feet by scent. On its turn, the creature must move toward the nearest creature of its type by the fastest means possible. If it is within 5 feet of a creature of its type it must use its bonus action to make a bite attack against it. Your target has proficiency with its bite attack and deals damage equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier. If a creature of its type is not present within 150 feet of the target, it must attack the closest living creature to it. At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, the target can make a new saving throw. The target has advantage on its saving throw if it is triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends, and the target is poisoned for 1 hour, unless it is a cannibal or comes from a cannibalistic culture.
  <em>Festering Fever</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 177) – You infect a creature you can see within range with a magical, transmissible disease. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 necrotic damage and be infected with the disease. At the start of the target’s next turn, the disease ends on the target and moves to a creature hostile to you within 10 feet of the target. The new target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage and be infected with the disease. The disease continues moving from target to target in this way, reducing the amount of necrotic damage by 1d8 each time the disease moves to a new target. On a failed save, the final target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and this spell ends. If a target succeeds on a Constitution saving throw, it takes half the damage, and the disease doesn’t jump to a new target, ending the spell. A creature can take damage from this spell only once per casting of this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Fever's Gift</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 177) – You infect yourself with a magical fever for the duration. While infected, you are poisoned, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to experience a portentous hallucination. If you do so, one friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you has advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
  <em>Fey Tricks</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 177) – With a wink and a nod, you attempt to take control of a spell as it is being cast. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or lower, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, you gain control of the spell as if you cast it from that creature’s space. You can choose the direction of the line, the point where the spell is centered, the spell’s targets, and any other parameters of the spell. If the spell has a range of Self and doesn’t affect other targets, fey tricks fails. For example, you can redirect the line of a lightning bolt spell with the original caster as the origin, but you wouldn’t be able to take control of the false life spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell you take control of can be less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
  <em>Dreamstride</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 172) – You reach out with your consciousness and step into the dreams of a creature you can see or a creature that is known to you. The creature must be on the same plane of existence as you and have a minimum Intelligence score of 7. If the target is not asleep or in meditation (in the case of elves or similar races) when the spell is cast, the spell fails. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead. When you cast the spell, you enter your target’s dream, and you view the events as an invisible third party. The creature is unaware of your presence, and you cannot interact with the dream in any way other than the method listed below. As an action, you can reach out your consciousness and attempt to influence the course of the dream. For example, you may cause something new to appear or cause the tone of the dream to change to a nightmare (or vice-versa) or influence a “character” in the dream other than the target to act a certain way. When you attempt to influence the dream, your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, your attempt to alter the dream is successful. On a successful save, you are immediately ejected from the dream as the dreamer awakens. For the duration of the spell, your body lies in repose in the location you cast the spell. You are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings, though you can feel and are aware if you take damage. If your body is moved, the spell ends. If your target is awakened, the spell ends.
  <em>Drizzle</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 172) – You conjure up a very light rain, enough to dampen the ground in a 20-foot square but not enough to drink or to put out a fire of any size larger than a candle or match. If sustained for 1 minute, the ground is wet to the touch, and if sustained for 10 minutes, the affected area is slightly muddy or slippery, though not enough to impede movement. In freezing weather, this may generate a coating of thin ice.
  <em>Dust And Ashes</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 172) – A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be any nonmagical physical object, to a maximum size of 10 feet on a side. If the target is held by a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object is reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. This spell automatically and completely disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the object size increases by another 10-foot-cube for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Dying Of The Light</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 172) – A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a 120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished. Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function within the area. Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light 1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical darkness, such as devils. You can see within the area of the spell as if it were brightly lit. Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the exhaustion.
  <em>Magma Spray</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 197) – 2nd-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 40 feet Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur or a piece of brimstone) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A 5-foot-diameter, 5-foot-tall cylindrical fountain of magma erupts from the ground in a space of your choice within range. A creature in that space takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature that enters the area on its turn or ends its turn there also takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. A creature whose hit points are reduced to 0 by this damage is killed immediately, and its body burns to ash. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Magnetic Bolt</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 197) – 1st-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self Components: V Duration: 1 minute The first time you hit with a ranged weapon attack before this spell ends, the ammunition becomes magically magnetized as it hits the target. The magnetized ammunition clings to the target until removed. When the target moves into or through a space that is within 10 feet of a creature wearing metal armor or of a Small or larger metal object, such as an anvil, a statue, a decorative suit of armor hanging on a wall, or similar, the target treats that space as difficult terrain as the magnetized ammunition pulls the target toward that creature or object. A creature with magnetized ammunition clinging to it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the ammunition is removed and crumbles to dust. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can magnetize one additional piece of ammunition for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Magnify Weapon</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 197) – 2nd-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self Components: V Duration: 1 minute The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon grows larger just before impact and deals one additional die of its damage. Then your weapon returns to its normal size, and the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can magnify your weapon for one additional hit before the spell ends for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Malaise</em> (1st <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 197) – 1st-Level Illusion Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a scrap of handkerchief from a fever victim) Duration: 10 minutes You craft an illusion around a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, creating phantom symptoms of a disease. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer one or more of the following symptoms of your choice for the duration: • An illusory fever where the target feels feverish and hot to the touch. • The target has a persistent, scratchy throat, prompting occasional coughs. • The target sees minor spots or has blurry vision at their periphery. • The target’s skin manifests illusory, itchy spots, boils, or rashes, prompting occasional scratching. Until this spell ends, the target has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. After failing three of these saving throws, the spell’s effects last for the duration. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours.
  <em>Raise Shade</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 213) – 4th-Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 hour Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous This spell is identical to raise ghost in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it’s not sufficient to wield one in combat or to draw a bow.
  <em>Rat Plague</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 213) – 3rd-Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: 3 days Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with one of two possible rat plagues, described below. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing threeof these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends. Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it. Rat Fever. A creeping horror of rats, ratfolk, wererats, and all other rat-like creatures enters the creature’s mind, and it fears contact with rats and is terrified of crowds. The creature is frightened of rats for the duration. Rat Shakes. Violent shivers convulse the creature’s limbs, its speed is halved, and it cannot use the Dash action. After making any melee or spell attack, the creature falls prone.
  <em>Reaper's Balm</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 213) – 2nd-Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a pinch of grave dirt mixed with resin) Duration: 1 hour Your touch wards a creature against death. For the duration, the target has advantage on death saving throws. If a dying creature affected by this spell succeeds on three death saving throws and becomes stable, the spell ends.
  <em>Reassemble Bones</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 213) – 1st-Level Transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a bone from an undead creature) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute Your body and bones become malleable. For the duration, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to take on a compressed form, allowing you to fit into a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. While in this compressed form, you can’t make melee weapon attacks. You can use a bonus action again to return to your normal form.
  <em>Recreate Event</em> (7th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 213) – 7th-Level Illusion Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Self (30-foot cube) Components: V, S, M (a time piece made of brass and inlaid with diamonds worth at least 250 gp) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Your magic summons an illusory recreation of an event, allowing you to watch and learn from different angles. When you cast this spell, choose a period of time you have experienced within the last 7 days that is up to 1 minute long. Illusory copies of the people, places, and events that existed within 30 feet of you during that minute fill the spell’s area. The illusion appears centered on the past version of you and is recreated from your perspective at the time you experienced it. The recreation is not limited to your line of sight, and it magically recreates everything that occurred within 30 feet of you at that time. For the duration, you can command the illusion to replay, pause, speed up, or slow down as you wish. You and other creatures can walk within the illusory scene, investigating and watching the event. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made while observing the event. The spell doesn’t provide insight into the minds of creatures that were present at that time, and it is limited to actions and movements that could have been observed by an average person experiencing the event. For example, it might depict wet footprints left by an invisible creature that walked past you during the event, but it wouldn’t reveal the invisible creature.
  <em>Utterance</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 234) – You speak a short phrase, momentarily allowing your patron to voice itself through you in a terrifying display. Your pupils go white, and you body takes on other minor manifestations befitting your patron, such as demonic wings, writhing tentacles, multicolored fur, and similar. Choose up to three creatures within range that can see and hear you. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d8 psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Vanish Within</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 234) – As a creature of your size or larger approaches, you magically step into the creature, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the creature until the start of your next turn. A hostile creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. At the start of your next turn, you emerge from the target into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. While merged with the target, nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. You can’t see what occurs outside the target and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it have disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time, but you can’t move or cast spells on yourself while merged. The creature you meld with is aware of your presence, and it can move and take actions normally. Damage to the creature doesn’t affect you. However, if the creature dies or is transformed while you are merged with it, you are expelled into the nearest unoccupied space, fall prone, and take 25 bludgeoning damage and 25 necrotic damage.
  <em>Varina's Virtuous Valediction</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 234) – You cause the spirit of a dying creature to briefly appear in a flash of holy light. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
  <em>Vengeful Spirits</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 234) – You invite slighted spirits to take revenge upon a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d8 psychic damage and is frightened of you until the spell ends. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. If the target has a Charisma score of 2 or lower, the spell fails.
  <em>Venomous Thoughts</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 234) – You protect your mind with psychic poison. Until the spell ends, each time a creature attempts to read or detect your thoughts, speak with you using telepathy, influence your dreams, or perceive you through magical scrying sensors, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 4d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on successful one.
  <em>Conjure Thicket</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 156) – You cause a robust bramble bush to sprout in a space on the ground you can see within range for the duration. The bush must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, but it can otherwise look like any thorned bush you want. The thicket has hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and vulnerability to fire damage, and any creature within 5 feet of the bush has three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side of the bush. A creature in the chosen space when you cast this spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The creature is then pushed to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the bush. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Conjure Vermin</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 156) – You summon fiendish spirits that take the form of sickly swarms of crows, maggots, or rats in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears: One swarm of maggots (use the statistics of a swarm of insects (beetle)), Two swarms of crows (use the statistics of a swarm of ravens), or Two swarms of rats. Each swarm is also considered a Fiend, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned swarms are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the swarms as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. Until this spell ends, you can use an action to force one of the swarms you control to cause one of the following effects, based on the type of swarm. Once you use this action, that swarm disappears. Swarm of Crows. One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Swarm of Maggots. One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned with horror and nausea until the end of its next turn. Swarm of Rats. One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned by filth until the end of its next turn. The GM has the creatures’ statistics. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 4th-level slot, three times as many with a 6th-level slot, and four times as many with an 8th-level slot.
  <em>Contagious Healing</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 156) – Your touch infects a friendly creature with a magical disease. The target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The next time the target takes damage, the disease ends on the target and infects a new friendly creature within 10 feet of the first. The new target regains hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. The next time the new target takes damage, the disease ends on it and moves to another friendly creature within 10 feet of it, continuing in this manner until no valid targets are in range or the spell ends. A creature can be healed by your contagious healing only once per casting of this spell. This spell has no effect on Undead or Constructs. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Contingency Boils</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 157) – Choose a necromancy spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and has a range of Touch. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency boils, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. The contingent spell is stored in a boil on your skin that is created as part of the casting of contingency boils. Each time you cast contingency boils, you create a new boil on your skin. Your skin can contain a number of contingent spells within boils equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. For each boil on your skin, your Charisma score is reduced by 2 until you no longer have any boils from this spell on your skin. When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to rupture a boil. The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the rupture, targeting the attacker. That boil and that instance of the contingency boils spell then ends. If you are affected by lesser restoration, greater restoration, or a similar effect that removes diseases (such as a paladin’s Lay on Hands), all your boils are immediately cured and all instances of the spell end, removing all remaining boils and their stored spells. 
  <em>Court The Flame</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 157) – You court the power of a nearby fire to shield you. Choose one source of nonmagical fire that is the size of a torch or larger within 5 feet of you. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC for the duration. Until this spell ends, if you would take fire damage from any source, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage to 0. If you do, the spell ends. If you spend at least 1 minute more than 5 feet away from the source of fire you chose when you cast this spell, the spell immediately ends. 
  <em>Create Graveyard Dragon</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 157) – Choose a corpse of a Huge or Large dragon within range. This corpse becomes a graveyard dragon, a skeletal dragon wrapped in energy of the dragon’s type, under your control. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command the dragon if the creature is within 120 feet of you. You decide what action the dragon will take and where it will move  during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the dragon only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the dragon continues to follow it until its task is complete. The dragon is under your control for 8 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the dragon for another 8 hours, you must cast this spell on the dragon before the current 8-hour period ends, or you can use an action to make an ability check using your spellcasting ability contested by the dragon’s Charisma check, reasserting your control over the dragon for another 8 hours on a success. This use of the spell reasserts your control over the dragon rather than animating a new one. Once you have reasserted your control over the dragon with two successful checks, you can’t do so again until you reassert your control over the dragon at least once with a casting of this spell. The GM has the statistics for this creature, using a graveyard dragon (see Tome of Beasts 2) or a young black dragon with resistances and damage types appropriate to the type of dragon you targeted with this spell and with the following bonus action: Reassemble Bones. As a bonus action, the dragon can rearrange its bone structure to fit into a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. It can use a bonus action to reassemble itself into its normal form. While in this compressed form, it can’t make melee weapon attacks. 
  <em>Raise Ghost</em> (3rd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 212) – You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its prior relationship with you, if any. The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It regains hit points normally through resting or spending Hit Dice but never recovers hit points via spells, items, or potions. This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance— the spell automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has a –4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal, physical life by raise dead or comparable magic. Raise ghost has no effect if cast on an Undead creature.
  <em>Raise Hero</em> (4th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 212) – This spell is identical to raise dead in every way except duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a d20. If the roll is equal to or less than the number of prior castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the clock to 24 hours; it doesn’t stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.
  <em>Raise Nemesis</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 212) – This spell is identical to raise dead, except it simultaneously raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar power also returns to life. The second corpse must be within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They aren’t compelled to battle one another or even to seek each other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other also drops dead instantly. Evil  NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically see it as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable.  If the spell is cast on a creature of true Neutral alignment, only that creature is restored to life.
  <em>Raise Questing Dead</em> (6th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 212) – This spell is identical to raise dead, except it empowers you to impose a geas on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn’t restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.
  <em>Verbal Assault</em> (4 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 235) – You utter words of power laced with deadly psychic energy. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
  <em>Vine Trestle</em> (2 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 235) – You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length, which can be a number of feet up to 5 × your spellcasting level. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates. The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 × your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.
  <em>Vision Slip</em> (2 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 235) – You cause the vision of up to three creatures you can see within range to blur, slide, and churn in a nauseating fashion. Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also poisoned for 1 minute. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Visions Of Home</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 235) – You manifest an illusory reminder of home to comfort your allies or distract your enemies. Choose up to three creatures you can see within range. Each target is affected differently, depending on if it is friendly or hostile to you. Friendly. For the duration, each target has advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and it can use its reaction once before this spell ends to end the blinded, deafened, or poisoned condition on itself. Hostile. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be taunted by visions of its home in danger. For the duration, each target has disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. In addition, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to deal 2d6 psychic damage to one of these targets. At the end of each of its turns, a hostile target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each spell slot above 3rd.
  <em>Vortex Of Steam</em> (3 <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 235) – A swirling vortex of hot steam in a 5-foot-radius, 15-foot-high cylinder erupts in the space of a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 fire damage and is restrained for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make another Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 fire damage and remains restrained. On a successful save, it doesn’t take any damage and escapes the vortex into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the vortex. Until the spell ends, if the vortex isn’t restraining a creature, you can use a bonus action to move it up to 20 feet. If you ram the vortex into a creature, that creature must make the Dexterity saving throw with the DC equal to the vortex’s damage, becoming restrained on a failed save as normal, and the vortex stops moving. When you move the vortex, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall, hover it at ground level over pits up to 10 feet deep, and skim it across the surface of calm water. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 (both initial and later) for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Lunarbolt Waxing</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 196) – You hurl a bolt of concentrated moonlight at a creature you can see within range. The bolt expands in size and grows in strength as it travels. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, a target takes 1d10 cold damage and suffers additional damage based on the distance between you and the target, as detailed below:   • If the target is between 35 and 60 feet away from you, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. • If the target is between 65 and 90 feet away from you, it takes an additional 2d4 radiant damage. • If the target is between 95 and 120 feet away from you, it takes an additional 3d4 radiant damage.
  <em>Magic Dampening Field</em> (3rd-level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 196) – When you cast this spell, choose a school of magic. A 30-foot-radius invisible sphere surrounds you, dampening magic of the chosen school. When a creature in the spell’s area casts a spell of the chosen school, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or the spell fails to cast, expending the action and the spell’s use or spell slot.Active magical effects of the chosen school, such as the spell false life when dampening necromancy or the spell mage armor when dampening abjuration, are suppressed while within this spell’s area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. This spell has no affect on spells cast outside the spell’s area.
  <em>Earth Glide</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 173) – This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone for the duration. Each target gains a burrowing speed equal to half its walking speed. While burrowing, an affected target doesn’t disturb the material through which it moves. If the duration ends with an affected target within unworked earth or stone, the spell carries the target to the surface at a rate of 60 feet per round.
  <em>Een's Armor Of Glass</em> (6th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 173) – You conjure a magical suit of glass armor over your existing armor and apparel for the duration. The glass armor appears in any color and style you choose. If you are wearing heavy armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls as the bulk of the glass armor on top of the heavy armor limits your range of movement. Until this spell ends, your AC increases by 3 and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would alter your form. When you cast this spell, the armor has a number of charges equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Whenever you take cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and reduce that damage to zero. The spell ends early if all charges are expended. If you take thunder damage while wearing this glass armor, you must make a Constitution saving throw as if you were concentrating on a spell. On a failed save, this spell ends, as the glass armor shatters from the thunder damage.
  <em>Een's Molten Shard</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 173) – You conjure two small, magical shards of molten glass that circle around you. The shards appear in any color and pattern you wish. Until this spell ends, you can use your reaction to command a shard to hinder one melee attack against you. If you do so, that shard flies between you and your attacker and shatters, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits you, the attacker takes 1d4 piercing damage. When all shards have shattered, the spell ends. The spell conjures one additional shard when you reach 5th level (three shards), 11th level (four shards), and 17th level (five shards).
  <em>Everan's Scorching Serpents</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 176) – You summon a serpent made of flames to burn and constrict one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and is grappled by the fiery serpent. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t grappled. At the end of each of the grappled target’s turns, it takes 2d6 fire damage. A creature grappled by the fiery serpent can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the target’s choice) against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer grappled, and the spell ends on it.
  <em>Expel Heresy</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 176) – You prevent heresy from escaping the lips of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to speak against your deity or faith. For the duration, the target coughs and chokes each time it attempts to speak a heresy of your faith or it attempts to speak anything hateful or negative about your deity, faith, or the faithful. In addition, if the target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component targeting you or another member of your faith, or if it attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component while in a place dedicated to your deity, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails to cast, expending the action used to cast it but not the spell slot or use. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is in a location sacred to your deity or faith, such as a temple or shrine. On a success, the spell ends.
  <em>Extract Essence</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 176) – You extract the goodness from food, pulling all the nutritional value out of three days’ worth of meals and concentrating it into a tablespoon of bland, flourlike powder. The flour can be mixed with liquid and drunk or baked into bread. When consumed, it still imparts all the nutritional value of the original food. The original food appears unchanged, and though it’s still filling, it has no nutritional value. Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, you can choose to have each day’s worth of meals take the form of a single slice of bread.
  <em>Faerie Toast</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 176) – You and up to five other creatures make a toast and drink to the lords and ladies of the fey. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following toasts, the targets of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting. Commiseration. Spellcasting participants can form or join a hag coven. While in the coven, each of the participants can share spell slots among themselves. Spells known by one member of the coven are known by all members of the coven for the duration and can be cast using any of the shared spell slots. Friendship. For the duration, each of the participants in the toast becomes Fey, in place of its original type, and it has advantage on the first Charisma check it makes against a Fey each minute. Husbandry. For the duration, each of the participants can communicate with Beasts as though they shared a language (though they gain no magical ability to influence the creatures). Nightmares. For the duration, the first time a creature comes within 30 feet of one of the participants, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of all the participants for 1 minute. Playfulness. For the duration, each of the participants grows gossamer wings, and it can use a bonus action to flutter the wings and gain a flying speed equal to its walking speed. The participant must start and end its movement on a solid surface, such as a roof or the ground. If it is flying at the end of its turn, it falls to the ground and takes falling damage. If the participant flutters the wings again, the effect ends. When the wings have been used for a total of 1 minute, they disappear and this spell ends for that creature. Restfulness. For the duration, each of the participants gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed and can’t be put to sleep by a spell or other magical effect for the duration.
  <em>Clinging Shadow</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – You create a wall of oily, black smoke on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is covered in a sticky, heavy film of shadow until the spell ends. A creature covered in the shadowy film is blinded, takes a −1 penalty to its AC, and can’t benefit from being invisible. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall or ends its turn there, the creature must make the Dexterity saving throw. A creature covered in the shadowy film can take an action to wipe off the film, ending the effect on itself.
  <em>Cloak Of Shadow</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – You cloak yourself in shadow, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks against creatures that rely on sight.
  <em>Cloak Of Vermin</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – You conjure a writhing garment of living insects that protect you and harm your foes. While the spell is active, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the insects lash out, dealing 2d4 piercing damage to the attacker. As a bonus action, you can command your cloak to leave your body, becoming a swarm of insects, and enter the space of an adjacent foe. The swarm attacks that foe (the GM has the swarm’s statistics) until you use a bonus action to command it to return to you, the foe moves more than 5 feet away from you, the spell ends, or the swarm dies. You lose the protective benefit of the cloak when using it in this fashion.
  <em>Combust The Dead</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – You fill the body of one Medium or smaller dead creature you can see within range with fiery magic, causing it to explode in a burst of flame and bony shrapnel. Each creature within 10 feet of the body must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 fire damage and 2d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A body can be targeted by this spell only once. If the target body was dead for more than one week, the body is completely destroyed, and the creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Compel Mercy</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – You force the attacking target to be merciful. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or the damage from the triggering attack is halved. If the damage would still reduce the attacker’s target to 0 hit points, that creature is knocked unconscious but stable instead.
  <em>Concentration Smash</em> (1st-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 153) – The next attack you make before the start of your next turn has advantage if the target of the attack is concentrating on a spell. If the attack hits, the target has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain concentration after being damaged by your attack. If the attack is a critical hit, the target automatically fails the saving throw to maintain its concentration.
  <em>Biting Armor</em> (Cantrip <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 142) – You channel the never-ending hunger of a god of gluttony into one piece of nonmagical clothing or armor you can see within range, causing a fanged mouth to temporarily appear on it and bite its wearer. A creature in physical contact with the clothing or armor must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and have disadvantage on the next ability check or weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
  <em>Bitter Wind</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 142) – Freezing wind, forming a line 120 feet long and 20 feet wide, blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Creatures that fail the saving throw also take 1d12 cold damage and are knocked prone. If cast during cold weather or in dark or shadowy conditions, the saving throw is made with disadvantage. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you. The bitter wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, lanterns, and similar flames in the area. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.
  <em>Black Hand</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 142) – You gather the powers of darkness into your fist and fling dark, paralyzing flame. Make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30 feet of you. On a successful hit, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target and the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, Constitution-based ability checks, and Constitution saving throws for the duration of the spell. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
  <em>Knife Of Fate</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 192) – You speak a word of binding fate and point your dagger. A creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s fate is bound to one random ally of the target. Any damage or condition the target suffers is instead inflicted on the individual to whom they are bound, and vice versa. A creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time. This effect lasts until either of the affected creatures gains a level or are targeted by a heal spell or partake of a heroes’ feast spell, lifting the binding.
  <em>Krail's Maggot</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 192) – A 6-inch-long maggot forms inside a creature of your choice within range and begins to devour the target from within. Make a melee spell attack against your target while in range. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage from the maggot equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can repeat the attack against your target. As an action on its turn, your target can make a melee weapon attack against the maggot with a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. The maggot has AC equal to your spell save DC and 8 hit points per spell slot level used to create it. If your target hits the maggot, half of the damage is dealt to the maggot, and the other half is dealt to the target itself. If the maggot is killed, the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Krail's Rot</em> (5th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 192) – You target a creature of your choice within range with a wasting of the flesh. Your target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns for the duration. A target reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this spell has disadvantage on its death saving throws. If your target dies, you can raise it as a zombie as a bonus action on your turn and can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to mentally command it as long as you are within 60 feet of it. If you command multiple undead as a result of multiple castings of this spell or similar spells like animate dead, you can command any or all of them at the same time using the same bonus action, issuing the same command to each one. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher before the current 24-hour period ends. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, your target takes 6d8 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns and animates as a ghoul if it dies. If you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, it takes 9d8 necrotic damage and animates as a ghast if it dies.
  <em>Krail's Rupture</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 192) – You make a slicing motion with your finger, and you immediately break the grapple of the creature grappling you by magically entering their body and exiting them on the opposite side. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d12 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If cast in response to being swallowed, you exit the triggering creature’s body, regardless of how much damage you deal to it, and fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the triggering creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Tundra Hold</em> (5th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 231) – Magical ice quickly spreads from a point you touch, extending in a line 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each creature caught in the ice’s path must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. The line then becomes difficult terrain for 10 minutes. A creature restrained by the ice must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking 1d8 cold damage on a failed save. A creature restrained by the ice can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. If a creature remains restrained by the ice for three of its turns, it becomes petrified at the start of its fourth turn, turning into an ice sculpture.
  <em>Ugly Duckling</em> (2nd <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 231) – One creature of your choice within range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all Charisma checks it makes and anyone it speaks to is indifferent to them for the duration. If the target succeeds on a Charisma check while under the effect of this spell, it can make a new saving throw to overcome the effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional target for each slot level used above 2nd.
  <em>Umbral Storm</em> (9th <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 231) – You create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging  entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion. You can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area of the storm 30 feet in any direction.
  <em>Shadow Portal</em> (3rd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 219) – You create a door in the nearest wall, cliff, tree, or similar structure. It is immediately bound to a similar door up to 200 feet away. The near door must be a place within 10 feet that you can see while the distant door can be one that you can visualize or that you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as 100 feet straight down or 50 feet to the northwest and upward at a 45-degree angle.  Until the spell ends, any creature can take actions normally to open and pass through the near portal, which immediately teleports it to the distant portal. The spell ends after the duration or when a creature uses a bonus action to close the distant portal’s door.
  <em>Shadow Puppets</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 219) – You animate the shadow of a creature within range, causing it to attack that creature. As a bonus action when you cast the spell, or as an action on subsequent rounds while you maintain concentration, make a melee spell attack against the creature. If it hits, the target takes 2d8 psychic damage and must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
  <em>Shadow Shield</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 219) – A misty black barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +8 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you are immune to force and radiant damage.
  <em>Shadow Shunt</em> (2nd-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 219) – You enter the Plane of Shadow just as danger approaches. You vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Plane of Shadow until the start of your next turn, avoiding the triggering attack or spell. While on the Plane of Shadow, you are paralyzed, but you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which appears in shades of gray. At the start of your next turn, you reappear in the space you previously occupied or in the nearest unoccupied space.
  <em>Shadow Step</em> (4th-Level <em>Deep Magic 2</em> pg 219) – You can open a temporary portal between two darkened areas, allowing you to move from one such area to another without crossing the intervening space. If you start your turn in an area of dim light or darkness, you can open a portal to another area of dim light or darkness within range and transport yourself to that spot. Doing this uses up your movement for the turn, regardless of the distance traveled. You can use shadow step while prone. Moving in this manner does not draw opportunity attacks.
