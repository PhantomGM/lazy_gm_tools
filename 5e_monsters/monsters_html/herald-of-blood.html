<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood Armor:</strong> The herald of blood takes no damage from the first attack against it each round and ignores any nondamaging effects of the attack.</li>
<li><strong>Gift of Blood:</strong> As an action, the herald of blood can transform any fey, human, or goblin into a red hag, if the target willingly accepts this transformation.</li>
<li><strong>Grant Blood Rage:</strong> As a bonus action, the herald of blood can grant a single living creature blood rage, giving it advantage on attacks for 3 rounds. At the end of this time, the target gains 1 level of exhaustion and suffers 13 (2d12) necrotic damage from blood loss.</li>
<li><strong>Humanoid Form:</strong> A herald of blood can assume a humanoid form at will as a bonus action, and dismiss this form at will.</li>
<li><strong>Melting Touch:</strong> When a herald of blood scores a critical hit or starts its turn with a foe grappled, it can dissolve one metal or wood item of its choosing in that foe's possession. A mundane item is destroyed automatically; a magical item survives if its owner makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.</li>
