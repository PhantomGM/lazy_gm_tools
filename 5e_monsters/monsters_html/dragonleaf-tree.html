Additionally, the tree has advantage on any saving throw to resist Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks made to influence it to act against its masters.</li>

A black, copper, or green tree breathes a 60-foot line of acid; a blue or bronze tree breathes a 60-foot line of lightning; a brass, gold, or red tree breathes a 30-foot cone of fire; and a silver or white tree breathes a 30-foot cone of cold.</li>
