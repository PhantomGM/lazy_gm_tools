A sighted creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the drake must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated. At the start of a character's turn, a character can choose to avert its eyes and gain immunity against this effect until the start of its next turn, but it must treat the drake as invisible while the character's eyes are averted.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> the drake's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 20). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: faerie fire, moonbeam  3/day: plane shift  1/day each: gate, planar binding</li>

<li><strong>Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The drake exhales either fire or frigid air in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 78 (12d12) fire or cold damage, whichever the drake wishes, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.</li>
<li><strong>Searing Star (1/Day):</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 65 (10d12) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be permanently blinded.</li>
