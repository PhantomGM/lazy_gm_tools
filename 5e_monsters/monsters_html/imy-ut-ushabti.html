<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> The imy-ut ushabti regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</li>
<li><strong>Rent wrappings:</strong> A creature that touches or deals slashing or piercing damage to an imy-ut ushabti while within 5 feet of the creature shreds its delicate linen wrappings, releasing a flurry of skittering scarabs. The attacking creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid them. On a failure, these beetles flow onto the attacker and deal 3 (1d6) piercing damage to it at the start of each of its turns. A creature can remove beetles from itself or from another affected creature within reach by using an action and making a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. The beetles are also destroyed if the affected creature takes damage from an area effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ceremonial Greatsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Vomit Swarm (1/Day):</strong> The imy-ut ushabti parts its wrappings voluntarily and releases a swarm of scarab beetles that follow its mental commands. The statistics of this swarm are identical to a swarm of insects, but with the following attack instead of a swarm of insects' standard bite attack:</li>
<li><strong>Bites:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
