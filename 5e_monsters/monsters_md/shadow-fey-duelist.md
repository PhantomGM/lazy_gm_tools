### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The shadow fey makes two rapier attacks. If it has a dagger drawn, it can also make one dagger attack.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and a target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
### Reactions
- **Parry:** The shadow fey duelist adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the duelist must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
