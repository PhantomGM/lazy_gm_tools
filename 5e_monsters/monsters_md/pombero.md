### Special Abilities
- **Beast's Voice:** The pombero can magically speak with any beast and can perfectly mimic beast sounds.
- **Twisted Limbs:** The pombero can twist and squeeze itself through a space small enough for a Tiny bird to pass through as if it were difficult terrain.
- **Sneak Attack (1/turn):** The pombero does an extra 7 (2d6) damage with a weapon attack when it has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the pombero that isn't incapacitated and the pombero doesn't have disadvantage on the roll.
- **Soft Step:** The pombero has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in forest terrain.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The pombero uses Charming Touch if able, and makes two fist attacks.
- **Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13).
- **Charming Touch (recharge 5-6):** The pombero chooses a creature it can see within 5 feet. The creature must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage. The pombero can have only one creature at a time charmed with this ability. If it charms a new creature, the previous charm effect ends immediately.
- **Invisibility:** The pombero becomes invisible until it chooses to end the effect as a bonus action, or when it attacks.
