### Special Abilities
- **Eye-Closer's Curse:** If a sandman obtains a critical hit or successful surprise attack against an opponent, its talons scratch a rune onto the target's eyeballs that snaps their eyelids shut, leaving them blinded. This effect can be ended with greater restoration, remove curse, or comparable magic.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the sandman's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: darkness, minor illusion, plane shift (at night only), phantom steed, prestidigitation, sleep (11d8)  3/day each: hypnotic pattern, major image  1/day each: dream, phantasmal killer (5d10)
- **Stuff of Dreams:** Made partially from dreams and imagination, a sandman takes only half damage from critical hits and from sneak attacks. All of the attack's damage is halved, not just bonus damage.
- **Surprise Attack:** If the sandman hits a surprised creature during the first round of combat, the target takes 14 (4d6) extra damage from the attack.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The sandman makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
