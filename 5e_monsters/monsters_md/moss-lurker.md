### Special Abilities
- **Camouflage:** A moss lurker has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in forested or swampy terrain.
- **Love of Heavy Weapons:** While moss lurkers can use heavy weapons, they have disadvantage while wielding them.
- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The moss lurker has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Poisoned Gifts:** A moss lurker can contaminate liquids or food with poison. Someone who consumes the contaminated substance must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. When the poison is introduced, the moss lurker can choose a poison that also causes the victim to fall unconscious, or to become paralyzed while poisoned in this way. An unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage, or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.
### Actions
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Great Sword or Maul:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing or bludgeoning damage.
- **Mushroom-Poisoned Javelin:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 6 (1d12) poison damage and the target is poisoned until the start of the moss lurker's next turn. A successful DC 11 Constitution save halves the poison damage and prevents poisoning.
- **Dropped Boulder:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 100 ft. (vertically), one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.
