- **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
- **Languages:** Tosculi
### Special Abilities
- **Skittering:** Up to two tosculi can share the same space at one time. The tosculi has advantage on attack rolls while sharing its space with another tosculi that isn't incapacitated.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The tosculi warrior makes one bite attack, one claws attack, and one stinger attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Prepare Host:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one paralyzed creature. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is paralyzed for 8 hours. The paralysis can be ended with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell or magical effect that cures disease. (Because only paralyzed creatures can be targeted, a hit by this attack is automatically a critical hit; bonus damage is included in the damage listing.)
