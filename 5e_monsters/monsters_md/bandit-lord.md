### Special Abilities
- **Pack Tactics:** The bandit lord has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the bandit lord's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The bandit lord makes three melee or ranged attacks.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the bandit lord can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bandit lord. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bandit lord is incapacitated.
### Reactions
- **Parry:** The bandit lord adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so the bandit lord must see the attacker and be wielding a weapon.
- **Redirect Attack:** When a creature the bandit lord can see targets it with an attack, the bandit lord chooses an ally within 5 feet of it. The bandit lord and the ally swap places, and the chosen ally becomes the target instead.
