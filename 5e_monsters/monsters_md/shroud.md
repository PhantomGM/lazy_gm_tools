### Special Abilities
- **Amorphous:** The shroud can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Shadow Evolution:** Shrouds instantly become shadows once they cause a total of 12 damage. Any damage they've suffered is subtracted from the shadow's total hit points or abilities.
- **Shroud Stealth:** When in dim light or darkness, the shroud can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
- **Sunlight Weakness:** While in sunlight, the shroud has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
### Actions
- **Strength Drain:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by one-half that amount. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
