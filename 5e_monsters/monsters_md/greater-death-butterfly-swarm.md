### Special Abilities
- **Potent Poison:** The death butterfly swarm's poison affects corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
- **Weight of Wings:** As death butterfly swarm but with DC 16 Dexterity saving throw
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The swarm makes a Bite attack against every target in its spaces.
- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., every target in the swarm's space. Hit: 24 (6d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and prevents the poisoned condition.
