### Special Abilities
- **Spellcasting:** The stoneguard is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:  * Cantrips (at will): druidcraft, resistance * 1st level (4 slots): goodberry, speak with animals, thunderwave * 2nd level (2 slots): hold person, spike growth
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The stoneguard makes three granite maul attacks.
- **Granite Maul:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the attack hits, the stoneguard may also immediately cast _thunderwave_ as a bonus action. This casting uses a spell slot, but no material components.
### Reactions
- **Sentinel:** When a creature within 5 feet of the stoneguard attacks a target other than the stoneguard, it can make a single attack roll against the attacker.
- **Skin to Stone:** When the stoneguard is attacked, it may gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks until the end of the attacker’s turn.
