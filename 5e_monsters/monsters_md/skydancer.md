### Special Abilities
- **Evasion:** If the skydancer is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the skydancer instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Flyby:** The skydancer doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
- **Skysail:** The skydancer flies with a special weapon called a _skysail_ (see pg. 45). While the _skysail’s_ wings are extended, the skydancer can cast _levitate_ at will, and can spend an action to cast _fly_ on itself (no concentration required) for up to 1 minute once per day. This use of _fly_ instantly replenishes when in an area of powerful air elemental magic.
- **Spellcasting:** The skydancer is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:  * Cantrips (at will): guidance, shillelagh * 1st level (4 slots): fog cloud, entangle, jump * 2nd level (2 slots): gust of wind, skywrite
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The skydancer makes two skysail staff attacks.
- **Skysail Staff:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the skydancer makes this attack while flying, the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.
### Reactions
- **Slow Fall:** When the skydancer takes falling damage, it may reduce the damage by half.
