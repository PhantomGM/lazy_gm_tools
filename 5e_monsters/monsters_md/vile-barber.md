### Special Abilities
- **Close-in Slasher:** The vile barber has advantage on attack rolls against any creature in the same space with it.
- **Inhumanly Quick:** The vile barber can take two bonus actions on its turn, instead of one. Each bonus action must be different; it can't use the same bonus action twice in a single turn.
- **Invasive:** The vile barber can enter, move through, or even remain in a hostile creature's space regardless of the creature's size, without penalty.
- **Nimble Escape:** As a bonus action, the vile barber can take the Disengage or Hide action on each of its turns.
- **Pilfer:** As a bonus action, the vile barber can take the Use an Object action or make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
- **Shadow Step:** As a bonus action, the vile barber magically teleports from an area of dim light or darkness it currently occupies, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 80 feet to any other area of dim light or darkness it can see. The barber then has advantage on the first melee attack it makes before the end of the turn.
