### Special Abilities
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
- **Magic Immunity:** The manabane scarab swarm is immune to spells and other magical effects.
- **Scent Magic:** The manabane scarab swarm can detect the presence of magical creatures, active spells or spell effects, and magical items within 120 feet.
- **Mana Erosion:** The manabane scarab swarm consumes magic. Unattended magic items in the swarm's space at the end of the swarm's turn have their effects suppressed for 1 minute. Additionally, charged items in the swarm's space lose 1d6 charges at the start of each of the swarm's turns; items with limited uses per day lose one daily use instead, and single-use items such as potions or scrolls are destroyed. Magical effects in the swarm's space are dispelled (as if affected by dispel magic cast with +5 spellcasting ability).
### Actions
- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or one randomly determined magic item in its possession is immediately affected by the Mana Erosion trait. A spellcaster hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or one of its lowest-level, unused spell slots is expended.
