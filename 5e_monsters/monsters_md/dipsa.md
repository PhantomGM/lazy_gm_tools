### Special Abilities
- **Swamp Stealth:** The dipsa gains an additional +2 (+9 in total) to Stealth in swamp terrain.
- **Amorphous:** The dipsa can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Discreet Bite:** The bite of a dipsa is barely perceptible and the wound is quickly anesthetized. A creature bitten must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the attack or any damage taken from it.
- **Translucent:** The dipsa can take the Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.
### Actions
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the dipsa's space. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the dipsa attaches to the target. A creature with a dipsa attached takes 3 (1d6) acid damage per round per dipsa, and it must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction to a creature's hit point maximum lasts until it is affected by a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic.
