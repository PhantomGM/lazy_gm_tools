- **Tidal Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a crushing wave of frigid seawater in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and 11 (2d10) cold damage, and is pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a successful save the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.
