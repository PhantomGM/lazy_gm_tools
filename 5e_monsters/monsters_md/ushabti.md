### Special Abilities
- **Dynastic Aura:** A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the ushabti must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, unless the ushabti is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature has its breath stolen; it takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, and until the end of the ushabti's next turn, can't cast spells that require a verbal component or speak louder than a whisper. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this ushabti's Dynastic Aura for the next 24 hours.
- **Healing Leech:** If a creature within 30 feet of the ushabti regains hit points from a spell or a magical effect, the creature gains only half the normal number of hit points and the ushabti gains the other half.
- **Immutable Form:** The ushabti is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ushabti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The ushabti's weapon attacks are magical.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The ushabti makes one attack with Medjai's scepter and one with its khopesh.
- **Medjai's Scepter:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.
