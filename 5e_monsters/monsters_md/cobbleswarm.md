- **Shift and Tumble:** As a bonus action, the swarm can push a prone creature whose space it occupies 5 feet.
- **Shifting Floor:** Whenever the swarm moves into a creature's space or starts its turn in another creature's space, that other creature must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A prone creature must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to stand up in a space occupied by the swarm.
