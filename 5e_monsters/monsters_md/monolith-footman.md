### Special Abilities
- **Blatant Dismissal:** While in the courts or castles of the fey, a monolith footman that scores a successful hit with its longsword can try to force the substitution of the target with a shadow double. The target must succeed at a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed, while an illusory version of itself remains visible and audible-and under the monolith footman's control, shouting for a retreat or the like. Outside fey locales, this ability does not function.
- **Fey Flame:** The ritual powering a monolith footman grants it an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the construct's needs.
- **Simple Construction:** Monolith footmen are designed with a delicate fey construction. They burst into pieces and are destroyed when they receive a critical hit.

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) cold or fire damage.
