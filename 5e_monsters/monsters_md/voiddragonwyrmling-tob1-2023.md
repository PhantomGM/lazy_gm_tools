### Special Abilities
- **Chill of the Void:** Creatures with resistance to cold damage don’t have resistance to the cold damage dealt by the Void dragon. A creature with immunity to cold damage is still immune to the dragon’s cold damage.
- **Expert Void Traveler:** The Void dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. While traveling in the Void, the dragon magically glides on solar winds, covering immense distances in short times.
### Actions
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
### Reactions
- **Void Twist:** The dragon adds 2 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker.
