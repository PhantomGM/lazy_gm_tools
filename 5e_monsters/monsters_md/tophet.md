- **Fiery Heart:** A tophet's inner fire can be ignited or doused at will. Its heat is such that all creatures have resistance to cold damage while within 30 feet of the tophet.
- **Burning Belly:** Creatures inside a tophet's burning core take 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the tophet's turns. Escaping from a tophet's belly takes 10 feet of movement and a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** A tophet makes two attacks, no more than one of which can be a gout of flame.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack. +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d10+7) bludgeoning damage. The target is also knocked inside the tophet's burning belly if the attack scores a critical hit.
- **Gout of Flame:** The tophet targets a point within 100 feet of itself that it can see. All targets within 10 feet of that point take 22 (4d10) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.
