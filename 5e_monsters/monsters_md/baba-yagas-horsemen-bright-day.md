### Special Abilities
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the horseman is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: sacred flame  1/day each: dimension door, fire shield, haste, slow  2/day: daylight  3/day each: ethereal jaunt, phantom steed (appears as a horse colored appropriately to the horseman), plane shift (self and steed only)
- **Magic Resistance:** The horseman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Peerless Rider:** Any attacks directed at the horseman's mount targets the horseman instead. Its mount gains the benefit of the rider's damage and condition immunities, and if the horseman passes a saving throw against an area effect, the mount takes no damage.
- **Quick Draw:** The horseman can switch between wielding its lance and longsword as a bonus action.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The horseman makes three attacks with its lance or longsword. It can use Temporal Strike with one of these attacks when it is available.
- **Lance:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft. (disadvantage within 5 ft.), one target. Hit: 12 (1d12 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Temporal Strike (recharge 5-6):** When the horseman strikes a target with a melee attack, in addition to taking normal damage, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or instantly age 3d10 years. A creature that ages this way has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws based on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the aging is reversed. A creature that ages beyond its lifespan dies immediately. The aging reverses automatically after 24 hours, or it can be reversed magically by greater restoration or comparable magic. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to the temporal strike effect for 24 hours.
