- **Parry:** If the noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.
- **Nobles were raised to wealth:** A noble is trained in swordsmanship, but their greatest defense is their entourage of armed protectors.
- **In non-feudal societies:** Nobles are primarily noncombatants: the knight or veteran stat block better represents an aristocrat with extensive military experience.
