### Special Abilities
- **Immutable Form:** The weaving spider is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The weaving spider has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The weaving spider makes two trimming blade attacks or two needle shuttle attacks.
- **Trimming Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage and possible unmaking.
- **Poisoned Needle Shuttle:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.
- **Unmaking:** The weaving spider's speed and its slim, sharp blade can slice cloth, leather, and paper into scraps very quickly. Whenever a weaving spider's trimming blade attack roll exceeds the target's armor class by 5 or more, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or one of their possessions becomes unusable or damaged until repaired (DM's choice)
