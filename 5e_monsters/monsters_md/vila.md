Non-vila who fall asleep (including magical sleep) inside the ring have disadvantage on skill checks for 24 hours from the time they awaken.

- **Forest Meld:** A vila can meld into any tree in her forest for as long as she wishes, similar to the meld into stone spell.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the vila's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  3/day: sleep  1/week: control weather
### Actions

- **+1 Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Fascinate (1/Day):** When the vila sings, all those within 60 feet of her and who can hear her must make a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Those who succeed on the saving throw are immune to that vila's singing for 24 hours.
- **Forest Song (1/Day):** The vila magically calls 2d6 wolves or 2 wampus cats. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vila and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vila dies, or until the vila dismisses them as a bonus action.
