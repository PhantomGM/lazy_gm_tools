### Special Abilities
- **Amphibious:** The miremal can breathe air and water.
- **Swamp Camouflage:** The miremal has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.
- **Savage Move:** If the miremal surprises a creature, it gets a bonus action it can use on its first turn of combat for a claw attack, a bite attack, or a Bog Spew attack.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The miremal makes two attacks, one of which must be a claw attack.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Bog Spew (Recharge 5-6):** The miremal spews a noxious stream of bog filth mixed with stomach acid at a target up to 20 feet away. Target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
### Reactions
- **Muddled Escape (1/Day):** If an attack would reduce the miremal's hit points to 0, it collapses into a pool of filth-laden swamp water and its hit points are reduced to 1 instead. The miremal can move at its normal speed in this form, including moving through spaces occupied by other creatures. As a bonus action at the beginning of the miremal's next turn, it can reform, still with 1 hit point.
