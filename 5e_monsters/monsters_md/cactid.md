### Special Abilities
- **Hail of Needles (1/Day):** When reduced below 10 hp (even below 0 hp), the cactid releases a hail of needles as a reaction. All creatures within 15 feet take 21 (6d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The cactid makes two attacks with its tendrils and uses Reel.
- **Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is neither undead nor a construct, the cactid drains the target's body fluids; at the start of each of the target's turns, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 3 (1d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and drinks abundant water or until it receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. The cactid has two tendrils, each of which can grapple one target at a time.
- **Reel:** Each creature grappled by the cactid is pulled up to 5 feet straight toward the cactid.
