- **Light:** Activated living wicks produce light as a torch.
- **Melting:** A living wick loses one hit point for every 24 hours it remains lit.
### Actions
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Consume Self:** A living wick can be commanded to rapidly burn through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating fireball. All creatures within 20 feet of the living wick take 7 (2d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The wick is reduced to a lifeless puddle of wax.
