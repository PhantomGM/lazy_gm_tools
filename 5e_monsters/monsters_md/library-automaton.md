### Special Abilities
- **Extra-Dimensional Book Repository:** A small door on the chest of the library automaton opens into an extra-dimensional bookcase. This bookcase functions exactly as a bag of holding except that it can store only written materials such as books, scrolls, tomes, parchment, folders, notebooks, spellbooks, and the like.
### Actions
- **Gaze of Confusion:** The library automaton chooses one creature it can see within 40 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (3d4 + 2) psychic damage and have disadvantage on Intelligence-based checks, saving throws, and attacks until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw succeeds, then the target takes half damage and suffers no other effect.
- **Bibliotelekinesis:** This ability functions as the cantrip mage hand but can be used only on books, scrolls, maps, and other printed or written materials.
