### Special Abilities
- **Fishform:** As a bonus action, the waverider can transform into a **hunter shark** or **giant octopus**. While in this form, the waverider cannot cast spells, but can expend a spell slot as a bonus action to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended. When the waverider is reduced to 0 hit points, falls unconscious, or dies in this form, it reverts to its humanoid form. It can remain in fishform for up to 3 hours, and can enter fishform twice, regaining expended uses after completing a short or long rest.
- **Healing Tides:** Whenever the waverider casts a spell of 1st level or higher that affects a nonhostile creature, that creature regains 3 hit points (in addition to any healing the spell may provide).
- **Marine Empathy:** The waverider can speak with and understand aquatic plants and animals.
