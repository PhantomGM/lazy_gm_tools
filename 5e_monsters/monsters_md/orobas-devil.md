- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points and it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.
