### Special Abilities
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the firebird's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: guidance, purify food and drink, speak with animals  3/day each: charm person, cure wounds (2d8 + 5), daylight, faerie fire, heat metal, hypnotic pattern, tongues  1/day each: geas, heal, reincarnate
- **Light of the World:** The firebird's feathers glow with a warm light. The creature sheds light as dim as a candle or as bright as a lantern. It always sheds light, and any feathers plucked from the creature continue to shed light as a torch.
- **Warming Presence:** The firebird and any creatures within a 5-foot radius are immune to the effects of natural, environmental cold. Invited into a home or building, a firebird can expand this warming presence to its inhabitants no matter how close they are to the creature.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The firebird makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Blinding Ray (Recharge 5-6):** The firebird can fire a burning ray of light from its tail feathers in a line 5 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. Targets in the line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 24 (7d6) fire damage and become blinded for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.
